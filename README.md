ELENA Installation / Run
---

######Windows:

To install just unzip all the files into a directory you want.

You may need to add a path to BIN folder to system environment (e.g. &lt;app root&gt;\bin).

Otherwise you may use setup executable.

To open, compile or debug the programs and libraries use ELENA GUI IDE 
(&lt;app root&gt;\bin\elide.exe) or ELENA Command Line Compiler 
(&lt;app root&gt;\bin\elc.exe).

In ELENA IDE you may select File-Open-Open Project option and open an 
appropriate project file (*.prj). Then select Project-Compile option to 
compile the project and Project-Debug to debug it.

######Linux:

To install just unzip all the files into a directory you want and execute 
rebuild_lib.script under the superuser. Alternatively install debian package

To compile the program types : elena-lc your_project.project
