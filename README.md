ELENA Installation / Run
---

To install just unzip all the files into a directory you want.

To open, compile or debug the programs and libraries use ELENA GUI IDE 
(<app root>\bin\elide.exe) or ELENA Command Line Compiler 
(<app root>\bin\elc.exe)

In ELENA IDE you may select File-Open-Open Project option and open an 
appropriate project file (*.prj). Then select Project-Compile option to 
compile the project and Project-Debug to debug it.

NOTE: for some strange reasons F-Secure considers some binary files generated 
with ELENA as infected ones.
