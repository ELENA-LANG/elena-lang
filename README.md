######Windows:

To install just unzip all the files into a directory you want.

You may need to add a path to BIN folder to system environment (e.g. &lt;app root&gt;\bin).

Otherwise you may use setup executable.

To open, compile or debug the programs and libraries use ELENA GUI IDE 
(&lt;app root&gt;\bin\elide.exe) or ELENA Command Line Compiler 
(&lt;app root&gt;\bin\elc.exe).

In ELENA IDE you may select File-Open-Open Project option and open an 
appropriate project file (*.prj). Then select Project-Compile option to 
compile the project and Project-Debug to debug it.

######Linux:

To install just unzip all the files into a directory you want and execute 
install.script.

To compile the program types : ./bin/elc2 -c&lt;path to .project file&gt;

Contribute!

ELENA Project looks for programmers interested in learning the language and providing feedback.

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, and join in design conversations. 

You may try to implementing some of Rosetta code tasks : http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Elena
