ELENA is a general-purpose language with late binding. It is multi-paradigm, combining features of functional and object-oriented programming. It supports both strong and weak types, run-time conversions, boxing and unboxing primitive types, direct usage of external libraries. A rich set of tools is provided to deal with message dispatching : multi-methods, message qualifying, generic message handlers. Multiple-inheritance can be simulated using mixins and type interfaces. The built-in script engine allows incorporating custom-defined scripts into your applications. Both stand-alone applications and Virtual machine clients are supported.

### Features

  - Free and open-source (MIT licensed)
  - Complete source code

## Installing ELENA from source

To acquire the source code clone the git repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ELENA-LANG/elena-lang.git
    cd elena-lang

### Windows:

The compiler code is implemented in C++ and does not require external dependencies. You just need Visual Studio 2019 / 2022.

You have to add a path to _BIN_ folder to the system environment *PATH* or copy elenavm.dll and elenart.dll to _Windows\System32_ folder.

To build the compiler and API under VS2019 / VS2022 you have to go to the root folder and type:

    recompile60.bat 

### Linux:    

To compile the code in Linux you have to install GCC tool set

    sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib

Then you have to run the compilation:

#### For x86

For Linux x86 (i386):

    make all_i386

After this you can either install it globally:

    cd scripts/i386
    sudo ./build_package_i386.script 

or locally

    cd scripts/i386
    sudo ./local_build_package_i386.script

*Note : in this case you have to copy libelenart60.so into /usr/lib/elena or modify the configuration file bin/templates/lnx_console60.config and provide the correct path:*    

    <platform key="Linux_I386">
     <externals>
        <external key="$rt">/usr/lib/elena/libelenart60.so</external>  <!-- put your local path where libelenart60.so is located
     </externals>
    </platform>

#### For x86-64

For Linux x86-64 (amd64):

    make all_amd64

After this you can either install it globally:

    cd scripts/amd64
    sudo ./build_package_amd64.script 

or locally

    cd scripts/amd64
    sudo ./local_build_package_amd64.script

*Note : in this case you have to copy libelenart60_64.so into /usr/lib/elena or modify the configuration file bin/templates/lnx_console60.config and provide the correct path:*    

    <platform key="Linux_AMD64">
     <externals>
        <external key="$rt">/usr/lib/elena/libelenart60_64.so</external>  <!-- put your local path where libelenart60_64.so is located
     </externals>
    </platform>
    
#### For AARCH64

For Linux AARCH64 (arm64):

    make all_arm64

After this you can install it globally:

    cd scripts/aarch64
    sudo ./build_package_aarch64.script 

#### For PPC64le

For Linux PPC64le:

    make all_ppc64le

After this you can install it globally:

    cd scripts/ppc64le
    sudo ./build_package_ppc64le.script 
    
### Building samples

To build all existing samples you can go to the **examples** folder:

    cd examples60

and compile them:

**For Windows 32**:

    elena-cli examples60.prjcol 
    elena-cli rosetta60.prjcol 

**For Windows 64**:

    elena64-cli examples60.prjcol 
    elena64-cli rosetta60.prjcol 

**For Linux 32 (i386)**:

    elena-cli examples60.linux.prjcol 
    elena-cli rosetta60.linux.prjcol 

**For Linux 64 (amd64, aarch64, ppc64le)**:

    elena64-cli examples60.linux.prjcol 
    elena64-cli rosetta60.linux.prjcol 

## Source Code Organization

The ELENA source code is organized as follows:

    bin                 binaries and shared libraries
    bin\scripts         scripts used by the script engine and VM console
    bin\templates       ELENA project templates
