Version 2.x.x
-------------
- system'dynamics'tape optimization, currently every object is checked if it is a message,
  could it be optimized (move the check to the message, the only question how one can
  check if it is a tape call)?
- maintenance: review postponed todo
- ide: make possible to copy content of output
= dynamic programming: beta
- maintenance: review known bugs
- elenavm script: make possible to dynamically declare static variable
- samples: multi-threading
- guiopencalc: gui description script (elenascript)
- elenavm: make sure several applications can work simultaneously
- guivmconsole
= vm: full support (console & gui)
= gcx: full support (including vm & gui)
= elc linux beta version version (vm, ide, debugger)
= full bytecode optimization
= elenavm optimization
= native code optimization
= dynamic programming: full support
- investigate memoryhashtable, find better hash functions
- engine: could we get rid of messages mapping table (though it should not increse 
  the link time)? maybe some numeric value which should be synchronized between modules?
  the literal string in that case will be defined by subject symbol name (what about
  private messages in that case?)
- debugger thread list
- upndown: work on net game
- eldoc
- asm2binx should use assembler style comments
- gcx optimization: should promotion happens less (the object should survive at least
  two collection?)
- LibraryManager: should be redisgned in such way, that multiple instances have common
  library container
- gcx: try to optimize write barrier supporting code (now it is 11 commands)
- gcx: full collection prediction: optimistic (in this case we have to control how
  much left in mg and if no place either tirgger major release or mark the object in
  write barrier) or pessimistic (major collection fires more often)
- multi-threading: thread safe static symbols(?), thread pool, mutex(?), semaphors(?)
- optimization: inline classes should be created immidately in the code and should not
  have its own reference name
- memory consuming;think over way how to free some resources, maybe free non used any 
  more modules?
- think over how could we minimize the number of duplicated VMTs
  e.g - every time basic'LiteralType create &length:x is used - a new VMT is created)
- optimize labYGStart function (reduce number of jumps)
- alternative vmt subject table with offset to particular subject
- upndown: game master should work in the separate thread
- multi-threading elenavm, instance::restart should stop all threads before restarting
  vm instance
- upndown - ai
- gcx: permanent heap, should be always collected(how to promote there)
- utc / time zone conversion
- digger
- biomorph
- kniffel
- jitliker: why all addresses are aligned to 8, makes no sense
- script engine: inline code validator? (to prevent errors like - 'program'output without &nil)
- optimization: group handlers (group, cast, union and so on)
- jitloader redesign: special auto-incremental field should be used for generating
  references, so no need to put into reference mapping dummy names, resolveNewSubject
  should be redesigned to support this
- elenavm: redesign debug support: step over the whole statement?
- mapReferenceKey optimization: could we use last or one before the last?
  (try to compare the compilation time (e.g. for upndown))
- linux: start to use build tool to create releases
- state machine samples
- ide: implement "find declaration" function
- usability: warn if vm client is debugged not under vm debug mode
  IDE should reload all debug info in that case
- optimization: nested in the nested inline class: the current implementation
  will be optimized only for the first nested class, the second
  one still hold the object rather then link to the field owner
- use get_count / get_size for the primitive code requiring object field count 
  (what about string / array code, code it be leaved like it is for optimization?)
- advanced byte code optimization / simple native code optimization
- make possible to set warning for every module (like pragma in C++)
- increase elenavm speed (caching, cachetable usage, 10%)
- increase elena code speed (up to 35%)
- ide: support thread list
- f:metamorphose - sample to demostrate the group modification 
- start x64 support
- convert elena projects to xml
- elenasm: try to minimize the memory usage
- elenasm: try to improve performance
- native code optimization: reduce branching
- internal subjects, subjects which could be send only from the particular module
  (but can be received by any other object)
- rosetta code: Arithmetic/Complex, Arithmetic/Rational
- support work windows registry(?)
- vm script utility: rule generator / verificator
- it should be possible to reserve but not commit heap for more effective
  memory usage
- enhanced IDE
- train algorithm
- increase elena code speed (up to 25%)
- x64 support (code generation)
- native code optimization
- optimize jitlinker
- ide2 wizards: make possible to selected method names from the list
- f:oolite
- ide enhancements: add project wizard
- ide enhancements: make possible to change the module order
- gcx optimization: could we optimize calculating of header position for compact phase 
- start to create basic unit tests to test lib25
- flagship project: tiny script language: lika
- ide2: new file should add default import statements, based on project template
- gcx: probably page equal to 10h is too small, maybe better to have bigger?
  (e.g. yg page 10h, and mg - 20?)
- forward module implementation: is it possible to optimize the implementation?
  (probably map it only if the reference exists)
- replace external functions with inline one if is does not call OS routine
- dsa rules: it should be possible to use syntax to generate source code
  (compiler compiler mode)
- ide2: win32 plug-ins
- full linux support (x64 + x32, console, gui)
- advanced native code optimization

- elt: code generation, it should be possible to create a code based on syntax
  expression
- there should be two build mode - release / debug
- start to use pentium commands
- start to use GetDateFormatExW (windows server 2003 will not be supported)
- robust api library
- ide2: linux plug-in
- Second public release
- localization to russian / any other languages
- IDE features supporting "Active code" concept
- x64 platform support
- CPU oriented optmization (at least for pentium 4)
- ide2: attach to another process
- full x64 support (both code generation + compiler and gui)
- f:simple basic interpreter
- is there any way to reduce the number of vmts, dynamic ones
- Linux full support (elc + elide + elenavm / gui + console)
- state of art IDE
- two major projects implemented with ELENA: upndown (graphics, ai) and
  jafm (ide, open architecture)
- Third public release
- tune GC, is it enough to survive twice before moving to OG?
- state of art lib30 (.net as a guide)
- to optimize access: the classes are stored in the module without namespace (so we could relocate the module without recompiling it) ;
  what about the links between the module members ? it may compilicate the code
