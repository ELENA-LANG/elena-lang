1. Program Structure, Project Types, Program Entry Point

A typical ELENA project consists of a project file (.prj) and source files (.l) located in the project root and sub folders.

Root source files are declared in the project root namespace, ones in sub folders - in nested namespaces.

E.g.

    <project>
        <namespace>mytest</namespace>
    </project>
    <files>
        <module>
            <include>test.l</include>
            <include>subns\test.l</include>
        </module>
    </files>

test.l file is declared in *mytest* namespace, subns\test.l one in *mytest'subns*.

_NOTE : By default all source files are UTF8 encoded. The project file is an XML document with *configuration* root node. In the current
implementation the project file contains no xml namespace attributes_

Typically the project compilation produces a single module file (.nl). But it is possible to specify multi-library output:

    <project>
        <namespace>mytest</namespace>
    </project>
    <files>
        <module>
            <include>test.l</include>
            <include>subns\test.l</include>
        </module>
        <module name="sub1">
            <include>sub1\op.l</include>
            <include>sub1\sub2\op2.l</include>
        </module>
    </files>

In this case several libraries will be generated - mytest.nl and mytest\sub1.nl

A project file contains the project settings, source files, forwards and so on. The project may be based on a project template. 
In this case it inherits all the parent settings except the overloaded ones. The template may be based on another one and so on.

Currently several major project templates are supported:
* console - STA CUI stand-alone application (templates\win32_console.cfg)
* mta_console - MTA CUI stand-alone application (templates\win32_consolex.cfg)
* gui - STA GUI stand-alone application (templates\win32_gui.cfg)
* mta_gui - MTA GUI stand-alone application (templates\win32_guix.cfg)
* vm_console - STA CUI vm-client application (templates\vm_win32_console.cfg)
* lib - ELENA library (templates\lib.cfg)

_NOTE : 
CUI - console user interface 
GUI - graphical user interface 
STA - single-thread application
MTA - multi-thread application_
