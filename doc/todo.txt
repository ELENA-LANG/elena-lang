               sdev - console samples
                       * simplify goods (Record.get&Literal implementation)
                       * words: sort the list
                       * simplify bsort

              adev - dynamic programming
                       * deserialize object
              adev - lib30
                       * literalvalue.add&type'short -> rewrite code to append char without creating a new temporal literal

                       * arrayiterator / array / literalvalue:getat, ... - raise an exception or return nil if the index
                         out of range
                              
                       * arrayiterator / array / literalvalue:setat, ... - raise an exception if the index
                         out of range                       
                       * system'io'MemoryStream - do not create a new integer after each operation
                       * add program default exception handler: dispatch an exception to
                         the program 
                       * system'$consolehandler: if the returning handler is -1
                         the exception should be raised (probably special method attributes like 
                         invalid_result and exception)
                       * system'$consolewriter - the exception should be raised if the operation
                         is unsuccessful
                       * system'Array: raise an exception if getAt goes out of range
                       * system'CharValue : only low word should be copied (either type'short or AND operation should be used)
                       * EReflector: raise an exception if NameOf returns zero
                       * common pattern: append list item separated by comma
                       * timespan: constructor?
                       * time: add month, year, hour, ...?
                       * date: set day???
                       * date: custom presenter / formatter / custom formatter
                       * extensions'EIntPresenter / EIntFormatter - can it work both for int and long numbers?
                       * list / iterators / ... - can commutator be used instead of adapter roles

            smaint - testing
                       * think over lib30 automatic testing based on script, e.g. write automatic test sequences which can be applied
                         to any object

week3:
              sdev - vmconsole

              sdev - prime project
                       * open calc : simple inline script to enter and sum two number; think over the most simple script to write quick code
                       
              sdev - prime project
                       * interpreter
                       * script program - calculator
                       * eldoc: dynamic parser

              sdev - visualizer
                       * build hello world sample by constructing / view / edit
                         tape

week4:
            xmaint - gc
                       * ackerman: test

            xmaint - compiler
                       * looks like the operation with console does not work with AMD!!!
              xdoc - blog
                       * publish the post about hello world script example (both interactive and tape, store the tape into the global
                         variable, visualize it content, execute it)
              xdev - test
                       * boxing: message target / operand, operator target / operand

                       
1.9.9.11
--------
week1:
              xdev - open arg
                       * can be passed further without boxing as open arg parameter
                       * any other operation should result in boxing

              xdev - multy select statement
                       * native implementation - using open argument list??

              xdev - generic development              
                       * break inside if inside loop - should break loop ??

                       * custom verb dispatching (see for example stringControl split&by[2])

                       * for loop: review for implementation algorithm can we simplify it??

                       * operator order @ (if make it smaller - the problem with double operator @ <<)
                       * support several roles in role (e.g. a~role1~role2 eval) ??

                       * several extensions: should it be supported, like in ELENA1.x
                         (system'dynamic'RoleList)  

                       * should be possible to declare sealed classes

                       * maybe primitive code should use reverse order as well, we could simplify a lot of code

                       * support the following syntax:
                              #method save:anObject &to:aTarget
                                  => EAdapter new::anObject.                          

                       * normal operation with data field should be boxed
                       * could it be possible to hide the inherited methods, so they could be used
                         only internally by the class (with $super)

                       * dynamic object extending : union, group
                         
                       * ecodes: index operation: probably the index should be inverted
                         before storing in the stack, to avoid the problem with GC for
                         big enough indexes

                       * resend operator: implement the situation when the target is
                         not constant

                       * hook and unhook consume stack, it should be reflected in bytecodewriter::save

                       * elc:Bytecodewriter::assignResult, should support both outer and normal
                         field assigning
                       * remove obsolete method handler code
                       
                       * could typed subjects be reserved for every module? So they have the
                         same ids in every module? (so we could get rid of long list of cached
                         values)
                       * loop should contain snop

                       * should be possible to include inline byte code section as well
                       
                       * stack allocated variable - try to find situation when overhead will be minimized

                       * hook: maybe offset should exclude call command size, so no need
                         in adjucment

                       * compileHelperOperation: implement size check for the output parameter
                       * warn if number of subjects / verbs are overflown
                       * a lot of operations with intNumber, longNumber and realNumber look
                         alike, can we try to generalize them?

                       * do not use self in constructor

                       * external call: do not support out'type'xxx:nil parameter, stack allocated one should be used
                       * hint role should indicate that no need to create a class class??

                       * readonly fields like in C# (some optimization gains?)

                       * local stack allocated variable (#var(type'int)theVal := 2) ; only int, long and real supported ; probably they
                         all (including implicit ones) should be declared at the method begin, so they will be cleared together
                         (think over elegant way to remove stack excluding)

                       * warn if system'Object does not contain send method

                       * probably import should work only with system modules?

                       * group object implementation
                       * using operators with an extension (e.g. anObject~EReflector @ anIndex)
      
                       * implement dispatching with several parameters
                         (see Compiler::compileDispatcher)

                       * loadverb should be not be implemented in elena.h
                         module
                       * raise an exception if more than 15 arguments in the method / message                 
                       
                       * simplify ansi constants / wideliteral interaction
                       * type'int (and so on): compiler should garantee that the
                         object returned / passed with with argument is integer
                         (warning?)                         
                       * resend: should inline statement be allowed?
                       * system'Object - equal - could we implement using ecodes?
                       
                       * warn if subject / verb is unknown (it means we should declare subject, but this function can be turned off)

                       * support all primitive arithmetic operations with different types: int x long, int x real, long x real

              xdev - ecode optimization
                       * system'object output code review (Object.equal)
                       
              xdev - simple optimization              
                       * do not need load acc if it is already in acc (see Object.equal)
                       * idle copyfpi, before close (see Object.notequal)

                       * if the target is stack allocated, no need to allocate extra space (at least for the single operation)? 

                       * review and optimize dispatching algorithm: $self, field, symbol

                       * optimize type'length virtual operation implementation (we do not need to save it in the stack)

                       * simplify int / long unboxing

                       * compileMessageParameter : no need to pass count as a reference, it can be increased in compilemessageparameters as well

                       * frame check should be possible to turn off

                       * we do not need frame in idle LiteralValue constructor             
                       * if $self is not used - we should not use init / popself ???

                       * review $ConsoleHandler.new&type'int - simplify the code
                       * control run &while &loop - support block code as a while parameter

                       * control run &while should be implemented as virtual loop as well
                       
                       * win32_console: use primtive type'length instead of type'int to pass the length without creating an integer object

                       * bsredirect: could the number of entries always be even, so no need to take this into acount?
                       * bsredirect: can we minimize the number of jumps (get rid of successful jump)
                       
                       * could we redesign ByteArray primitive operations using only operators?

                       * try to replace some external code with ecodes (e.g getting length / size, and so on)

                       * action symbol - every action symbol should be implement as
                         symbolloader ? (it is streight forward implementation for stateless, but if the action cotains the outer
                         links)

                       * primitivie operation - it should be possible to write something like
                         (see List) theCount := theCount + 1 - the compiler should replace the operation with inline
                         code without generating a new object each time

                       * compiler should replace and:action / and in virtual statement with
                         appropriate inline code

                       * it should be possible to turn off control virtualization, direct calls, optimization code, jumps

                       * elc api: optimize core_api'save_widestr
                       * constructor should return $self, so no need to assign it before exit             
                       * optimize control run & while virtual implementation

                       * replace enumeration / iteration loops with a virtual expressions
                       
                       * operator optimization: to avoid scanning the whole VMT, operator invoke
                         code could try to search first several entries before going to full search                                      

                       * optimized switch statement implementation (e.g. ordered ??)

                       * optimize !=, <= and >= implementation
                       * optimize index operation (literal / array) ; indexer should use more optimize algorithm
                       
                       * optimize ArrayIterator / MemoryStream, it should not generate every time a new object
                       * control operation, if the inline code cannot be implemented,  
                         the expression should be implemented directly?
                       * console entry: probably better to use symbol instead direct call
                       * elc - compileExternalCall: subject references should be resolved
                         only once, currently it's done several times
                       * Compiler::compileMessageDispatch - if only message was changed (with the same parameter) - only
                         message should be changed and resend further
                       * if the class is sealed, any operation with $self should be implemented directly
                       * use stack allocated object for the following code                            
                              theIndex less &type'length::theLiteral  - we do not now theLiteral "type", how could we fix it?
                       * system library: review all primitive operations - make sure optimized version is used
                       * control run &each &loop should be implemented as virtual loop as well
                       * direct message parameters can be used for the following construction if all the parameters of the second message
                         are constants / locals / fields  
                               presenterClassFactory new::anObject new:anObject &radix:aRadix.
                         
                       * review stack allocated data mechanism, think over more light-weight excluding stack mechanism
                       * type'length stack allocated variable should be used with bytearray as well
                       * external call: it should be possible to pass the direct link to the literal string in some cases
                       * idle copyfpi operation (when esp is not changed) , could we find them out and replace with nop?
                       * external call, it should be possible to pass the literal length without creating a new object

                       * return expression could be compiled without openning / closing frame (if no primitive operations are used, no code blocks)

                       * no need for boxing if the result is typed constant (e.g a message:2 - no need to box the operand)

                       * multiple-select if the type of operands are known try to optimize it ; for example of switch value is constant, maybe
                         better to compare value ?? (if it is true / false constants for example)
                       * could direct parameter allocation be used for open argument list?
                       * if acc already contains the required object, do not load it once again: e.g. Object.equal[1]

                         or sum operations, if the parameters are primitive types)

                         convert to another buffer (it will make three of them ???)

[oooo] Complex System Development:
--------------------------------
 0) Upndown
    - should we disable minimal tramp suit for joker dialog
    - add support for tcp/ip mutli player mode
    - play a basic round with a remote player
    - add possibility to scroll through the score table
    - develop ai player (aggresive, cautious)
    - in ideal solution, game'player'hand'enum may be called only be game master.
      Main form should be able to call it only for its player
   - repeat socket read until temporal buffer is not empty (it is possible
     two simultanius command will be combined on read operation)
   - the game could not be released from the memory if it waiting for the result;
     fix it
   - test if random generator generates actually a random numbers
   - continue move to ELENA: show the card on the table using the mask to make
     cards look oval
   - host panel should display the current IP address
   - the playground background color should be green
   - hide the cards when F5 pressed
   - make not possible to press any key inside edit box of Ordering dialog
   - unsynchronized prepare command could block the program exit (on close of main
     window should class onstop application event)
   - continue move to ELENA: show statistics
   - continue move to ELENA: load / save game
   - on connect make sure that clients and the host use the same program version
   - if makeorder or getcard is failed in gamemaster code it should try to send the
     command once again
   - use original colors
   - disable accept button on start.
   - disable search button after pressing.
   - !! check if frmConnector is destroyed and removed from referencepool
     after game start
   - close all unused connection after the game start
   - use buttons with original glyphs
   - modify the code to make possible any card game
   - use upndown sample as a testbed for the code optimization

-------------------------------
[x] ELENA Language Development:
-------------------------------
    - issue with super
    - super variable cannot be used with group objects, could we fix the issue?
    - is there should be special hints to be thread unsafe?

--------------------------
[o] ELENA API Development:
--------------------------
    - work with windows registry
    - make possible to truncate existing files
    - make possible to select system colors / brushes on the gui level
    - fcomip could be used only for pentium
    - make possible to execute another exe?
    - use createcomatibledc for every draw operation looks too expensive;can
      we modify paintboxhandler / imagehandler to do it only once?
    - make sure bitmap / hdc are properly released from the memory
    - for Image / PaintBox handle Paintstruct could be created as local one
      (no need to keep it on class level)
    - modify all float-oriented code to be correct, error handling,
      (should we save the float registers before operations?)
    - 'value' classes should support: min, max, succ, pred (int32value, real64value, ansichar)
    - is it possible to automize the process of data transfer over sockets?
    - database application which manage TODOs and KNOWNBUGs, possible to create
      what's new automatically, statistics
    - optimize insert / delete / copysubs to copy dwords rather then bytes / words
    - automatic code writing / reading from stream
    - optimize implement integer / longinteger modulus implementation in assembelr
    - basic'intnumber / longnumber / real should support method "in" to validate range
    - ext'utilities'Date should contain time in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1900
      rather then in milisecond since January 1, 1970 (UTC)

-----------------------------
[o] ELENA Sample Development:
-----------------------------
     - TextDB sample: load, save, search, add, delete records
     - calcgui should provide the list of calculation - in Listbox -> so we could select previous result
     - calcgui two modes: calculator like and the current one with the list of
       last operations
     - calc: make possible to declare constants
     - continue to work on graph sample: make possible to specify different
       functions, write your own ones, provide scaling and borders
     - new sample - expert system (prolog like sample)
     - new sample - logical game
    - regional time
    - examples to work with FileWriter

-------------------------
[xo] Compiler development:
-------------------------
    - weak references
    - group operation with the objects belonging to the different
      generations: could it be optimized?
    - localize elc to russian
    - get rid of comment warnings (starting with !!)
    - start to support Pentium commands (IA-32)
    - two compile mode - debug / release (we actually could have two
      sets of sections - with and without debug)
    - compile module only if it was  changed
    - start to support 64bit platform
       - probably we need to always use long jumps for bytecode jump command, it will
         simplify JIT compiler code
       - local properties
       - empty methods
       - methods which returns constant
       - think over send / index optimization (pairing, pentium commands, size)
       - try to optimize send routine (the most critical in the system)
       - cosntant collections / groups / casts
       - optimize group / annex routine
       - shl / shr commands considered to be not optimal
       - if inline object depends only on its class it should be created only once
         and saved as a hidden object field
       - reference helper should have a cache of resolved references
       - support linker map option
       - make sure hash table is effectively used in parser / compiler / linker
         (parsetable, module, linker)
       - super variable could lead to unexpected behaviour if we use dynamic mutation
         (after super self variable becomes $self one)
       - support strong references (both protected messages and classes), linker
         should check if they are valid
       - Remoting

       - make strong link to the parent class? (!!)
       - make possible to change basic linker options (opImageBase, and so on)
       - look like opGCHeapSize and opSizeOfHeapCommit are connected with each other
       - should codeBase is always 0x1000?; maybe should be customized (see !!
         remark in linker)
       - writeNtHeader: stack size and similar parameters is constant; maybe should
         be possible to customize (see !! remark in linker)
       - support resources in exe file
       - could we minimize the number of entries in call stack (direct return
         from any handler to the called code?)

       - try to optimize the parser table (less number of symbols)
       - inline classes can be created at the first reference to it and exists
         until the next GC call.
       - localization
       - support the following types of unicode source files:little endian, UTF-8?
       - new option target CPU: 386 / 686
       - add new coder: 686Coder whic override x86Coder
       - optimize the most critical code parts like send / redirect / cast routines
         using pentium commands
       - starts to use Pentium commands: we need to introduce the mode for
         i686 (cmov is not supported for older CPU, so we have to have two
         set of commands)
       - get rid of wait command for float-base operations?

       - x64 platform support
       - try to use pairing instructions
       - we do not need to check for 'mg -> yg conflict' for newly created
         objects
       - MMX, SSE, SSE2 commands; could we start to use these commands?
       - PREFETCH command could be useful
       - compiler option which specifies the target CPU
       - optimize constant implementation (due to gc every integer takes 12 bytes);
       - try different combinations to speed up : gc and send routines
    - relative fixup works incorrectly if the reference has an offset
    - make possible to declare the longest possible identifier with the
      longest possible namespace
    - check if Terminal is nsNone and generates the exception
    - optimize hash table filling for Linker tables

    - optimize the code using profiler
    - check for memory leaking (either profiler or simple check on the start
      and on the finish)
    - optimize hash table filling for ParserTable
    - check for all invalid / valid combination (russia characters)
    - check the debugger behavior in the case of system exception
      (does event EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occur in this case);
    - warn if you dynamically override itself (like #symbol my = #annex(my){...})

--------------------
[o] IDE development:
--------------------
    - should search history be saved, where (in the project / ide config / and so on)
    - implements new features: quick short cut
    - review known bugs
    - improve debugger
    - create simple version of ELENA Code Wizard which add new menu item
    - continue localization
    - give more useful error message if forward symbol is not declared
    - raise an exception if debug module not found by debug controller
    - debugger should use engine's LibraryManager
    - review and refactor elc output redirect routine
    - move fast short cut to autoform plugin
    - show the list of possible messages
    - auto add shortcuts
    - clear keyboard buffer before the program run
    - auto trim for tailing whitespaces (space and tab) - the idea is not to save
      whitespace until the user not to insert any character
    - open all recent files
    - option to ignore unresolved references warning within the project namespace
    - display current file encoding in the status bar
    - ctrl+F8 go to the next statement
    - call stack window
    - investigate stepping over / into annex inline symbols (e.g. $createHandle)
    - prevent from slowing down on the program exit (make possible to inidicate
      to the sistem that this step is the last in the program)
    - optimize debugger step collection access (use some kind of hash table,
      divide the code range into several bands and before direct search use
      it to narrow collection)
    - we do not need stop over inline symbols (except at the symbol beginning)
    - try to deal with the slowing debugger when it goes through the window
      system code in trap mode (e.g. in case of failed method in GUI application
      which terminates the application - is it correct?)
      (try to use breakpoint for any external code call to skip the step mode
      inside external written code - in fact no sense to do it)
    - gui applications are not released from the memory after debugging
    - test Undo / Redo operations for the small capacity (~40 or 50);
    - test operations with tab both virtual and real;
    - refactor dialogs module
    - too many duplicate code in editframe (toLowercase, toUpperCase, trim and
      so on), could we get rid of it?
    - maybe use CP_OEMCP then CP_ACP?
    - optimize (Styler)
    - check if window child created handles are destroyed (destroy method)
    - try to use DFA class for IDE sourcedoc class
    - possible problem when coping ascii text through clipboad - test with russian text
    - undo in overwrite mode works a bit strange
    - why if we have an error we do not see the warnings in messages window?
    - Plugins - and display message when selected
    - highlight the current line
    - new ide settings dialog: autocomp
    - debug watch should be able to display the longest possible identifer
      with the longest possible type e.g. IDENTIFIER_LEN * 2
    - show escape symbols
    - should not be possible close / open / compile project during debug -
      either break the debug or stop the operation
    - debugwatch should indicate if the object plays a role (shifted mode)
    - convert encoding routines
    - make possible not to load some source files (to simplify the debugging)
    - before start debugging make sure debug module is up to date
    - indent / outdent should align the selected code rather then simply
      move it (like in VS IDE)
    - find out optimal page size / history buffer capacity
    - tune up horizontal and vertical scrollers (like it's done in NP++)
    - set read only (?)
    - hide status bar (?)
    - display correct messages when the project is not compiled (missing
      exe / source files)
    - save the last active document / cursor position (?)
    - shows the number of warnings
    - source code assisten plug-in written with ELENA
    - configurable styles: colors / fonts
    - Outlining
    - Class Wizard
    - Auto complete?
    - Code patterns?
    - Message dictionary
    - error recovering (several errors)
    - make possible to change all tabs to spaces
    - code patterns like in VS (type short cut and press tab-tab)
    - Print
    - add Add Watch menu option
    - full screen mode
    - "find in files" function
    - Two editor panels like in NPP
    - clone current view
    - macros
    - autoformat
    - zoom in / zoom out
    - try to bring as much functionality as in notepad++
    - an icon on tab page?
    - make possible to treat the object as an array of bytes
    - make sure in the case of crash saveAllAsDraft and saveSettings are called
    - should we add the path to the recent history right after the project
      was open (or save the project even the program is crashed)
    - try to minimize the number of repaint (after pressing F8 repaint is invoked
      two times instead of one)
    - find out why sometimes IDE thinks the module files outaged when
      the project was just compiled
    - introduce project templates (with basic forwards)
    - make possible not to close the console window after the program finishing
    - add the editor option controlling this feature
    - tips?
    - new short-cut to got to message / output window
    - remove the code to import old style project file (project\projecttype)
    - why we create the string every time in EditFrame::paint function?
    - do we need now IDE_DEBUGGER_LOADMODULE notification? We are trying to
      load module every time now
