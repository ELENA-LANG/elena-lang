  [compiler]
    * !linux : method not found exception handling
    * GC : mov GC to C code : #77

  [project]
    * issues : #370, close all open issues for 5.0
    * release 5.0

  [documentation]
    * reddit : migrate all posts to ELENA 5.0  (using / finally statements in ELENA)
    * tutorials : migrate all tutorials
    * api : use manifest info for module description

  [!samples/api]
    * fix : 
    * !chat
    * rosetta code samples
    * timer
    * upndown
    * nodepad

  [language]
    * new feature : implicit constructor with variadic argument list should auto generate the implemeation for every
                      possible argument list (see system'dynamic'expressions);
                    __nowarning - modifier to surpress warnings for the expression (e.g in extension module);
                    catch several exceptions - could we simplify the code?

  [API]
    * usability : dynamic loading : give the symbol / message / subject name in the InvalidArgument exception

  [research]
    * !xforms : XAML xforms script

  [IDE]

Pipeline:
------   
                * duplicate boxing optimization : do not unbox presaved variable into temporal variable if it is not used
                  in the following sub expression (e.g a.then{ arg++ }.then{ arg++ }, second temp unboxing is not required;
                  the opcode can be optimized as well - get rid of duplicate acc loading code) - see duplicateTest

                * debugger : sub code - do not show the variable from noncurrent sub codes
                * system'dynamic'expressions: do we need TempVariableBlock? it cannot be translated into the normal code

                   (see SequentialEnumerator)
                 * optimize SystemTime
                 * uncomment __closuretape."#dispatch[1]  - check the subject correctly

                 * test unboxing with variadic arg list

                 * long constant should not be boxed like int constants

                 * reddit post - Switch statement

                 * identifier - message message

                 * the following code should be supported : newLength := newLength + cast int(theLength);
                 * TokenEnumerator : class TextBuilder should not be found (system'text is not imported)
                 * test try / catch operation : method not found, printing calling stack
                 * (re)implement dynamic variadic argument resolving
                 * primitive array should be passed directly without unboxing if allowed
                 * test - a[](...) - should be illegal
                 * test boxing / unboxing with dynamic reference
                 * support public & private templates
                 * property templates cannot be used directly and class templates cannot be used as a property one

                 * Indexer.Index property - should support abstract get and set accessors
                 * unboxing of boxing (in case if analizer does not resolve the issue)
                 * cache resolved built-in tampletes
                 * test all possible syntax combination
                 * simplify DerivationWriter :: newNode - use a common mask for all expression nonterminals
                 * optimizate operations with byref dynamic variable (no need for boxing / unboxing) - should be locally
                   boxed
                 * elt - exception handlers
                 * support mta_gui, vm_console, vm_mta_console
                 * the following code does not work - theOwner.resize(int width, int height)  (see forms'SDIWindowListener.onsize)
                 * interface - can the wrapper class be saved to use it several times?
                 * set operation with constant array should not be allowed
                 * vm client : incorrect error if the program entry is not defined
                 * support static prefix to allow operations with static field only
                 * sealed static fields, cannot be changed in the child classes?!
                 * remove all temporal exceptions
 
                 * debugger : step over message operation
                 * fix debugger watch : bsort - ref<int> is not correctly recognized
                 * test vm sta : preloaded symbols / initializers
                 * test vm sta : exception handlers
                 * vm : Runtime evaluation, Runtime evaluation/In an environment
                 * mta system : check the situation when too many threads (> MAX_THREAD)
