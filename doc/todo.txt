                       * stack allocated byte array should not be reserved second time

                       * why is not possible: "abc"@4 | onOutOfRangeError: ...

                       * make possible to send exception futher with ifFailed handler
                       
                       * check private method declaration ??

                       * role class should not be its own class class (like it is now), super class should be used

                       * role implementation (see arithmeval sample)

                       * group object implementation (group, union, cast)
                       * elenavm: use reverse instead of set of swaps
                       
                       * types : there should be limited set of types supported by language, no extension should be done beyond system namespace;
                         do we need to return type for every object??

                       * widechar constant
                       * filling with zero / nil should be done inside constructor
                       * dispatching : return type, could we support additional method or dispatch handler can be used, ...
                         think over type support, we need some generic solution (typecontrol should be declared for every set of
                         objects, which is not convenient) ; so maybe better to support type and do all other type of dispatching
                         automatically , e.g. a write::b is replaced by compiler => a(b type)~write:b.

                      * starts to use Pentium commands: we need to introduce the mode for
                        i686 (cmov is not supported for older CPU, so we have to have two
                        set of commands)

                       * dispatching variant : a write:(b~(a type)get)
             
                       * @ operator should support primitive implementation if loperand is array, bytearray and roperand is int

                       * out'type'xxx can be declared but cannot be implicitly passed

                       * write, append, ... operation should be allowed only with $self or out parameter
                            
                       * amb sample: can it be modified to use open argument list, currently for every number of parameters separate method should be declared

                       * constant array symbol (e.g. #symbol BoolValues = (true, false). )
                       * BoolValues and InvertedBoolValues should be used for branching primitive implementation,
                         modify the code, from reading bool values from stack to constant array

                       * support several roles in role (e.g. a~role1~role2 eval) ??

                       * several extensions: should it be supported, like in ELENA1.x
                         (system'dynamic'RoleList)  

                       * should be possible to declare sealed classes

                       * should class symbol always return class class (exception is role)? 

                       * support the following syntax:
                              #method save:anObject &to:aTarget
                                  => EAdapter new::anObject.                          

                       * could it be possible to hide the inherited methods, so they could be used
                         only internally by the class (with $super)

                       * dynamic object extending : union, group
                         
                       * resend operator: implement the situation when the target is
                         not constant

                       * hook and unhook consume stack, it should be reflected in bytecodewriter::save

                       * elc:Bytecodewriter::assignResult, should support both outer and normal
                         field assigning
                       * remove obsolete method handler code
                       
                       * could typed subjects be reserved for every module? So they have the
                         same ids in every module? (so we could get rid of long list of cached
                         values)
                       * loop should contain snop

                       * hook: maybe offset should exclude call command size, so no need
                         in adjucment

                       * compileHelperOperation: implement size check for the output parameter
                       * warn if number of subjects / verbs are overflown
                       * a lot of operations with intNumber, longNumber and realNumber look
                         alike, can we try to generalize them?

                       * do not use self in constructor

                       * external call: do not support out'type'xxx:nil parameter, stack allocated one should be used
                       * hint role should indicate that no need to create a class class??

                       * readonly fields like in C# (some optimization gains?)
                       
                       * warn if system'Object does not contain send method

                       * using operators with an extension (e.g. anObject~EReflector @ anIndex)
      
                       * raise an exception if more than 14 arguments in the method / message                 
                       
                       * type'int (and so on): compiler should garantee that the
                         object returned / passed with with argument is integer
                         (warning?)                         
                       
                       * warn if subject / verb is unknown (it means we should declare subject, but this function can be turned off)

                       * support: primitive operation int + long, long + int

                       * array item set operator a@b := c ???

                       * lcopystr : index should contain radix
                       * wsindexof... should be similare to bsindexof, search in edi for eax, [esp] times, starting from esi
                       * bs_findshort, bs_findbyte - check if index + length is not beyond string
                       * ws_indexof: check operations check if index, index + length is not beyond string
                       * test operation with stack allocated binaray array (write / read / length / getAt)
                        
                       * loadverb should be not be implemented in elena.h
                         module
                       * custom verb dispatching (see for example stringControl split&by[2])
                           : intNumber.shift ; stringControl
                       * multiple parameter dispatching

                         (see Compiler::compileDispatcher)              

                       * boxing after primtive operation should be done probably directly, i.e. implicitly create an object (int, long or real)

                       * support GUI application
                       * compiler option : switch off jump optimization
                       * compiler option : switch off direct calls

                       * if $self is not used - we should not use pushb bcopya / popb

                       * review and optimize dispatching algorithm: $self, field, symbol

                       * optimize type'length virtual operation implementation (we do not need to save it in the stack)

                       * for loop: review for implementation algorithm can we simplify it??

                       * simplify int / long unboxing

                       * stack allocated variable - try to minimize the overhead
                       
                       * ret expression: two breakpoints: maybe better to check for the tape to get rid of two breakpoint in row? 

                       * compileMessageParameter : no need to pass count as a reference, it can be increased in compilemessageparameters as well

                       * control run &while should be implemented as virtual loop as well
                       
                       * win32_console: use primtive type'length instead of type'int to pass the length without creating an integer object

                       * bsredirect: could the number of entries always be even, so no need to take this into acount?
                       
                       * action symbol - every action symbol should be implement as
                         symbolloader ? (it is streight forward implementation for stateless, but if the action cotains the outer
                         links)

                       * external call: do not need to copy stack allocated variables into the buffer

                       * operator optimization: to avoid scanning the whole VMT, operator invoke
                         code could try to search first several entries before going to full search                                      

                       * optimized switch statement implementation (e.g. ordered ??)

                       * optimize !=, <= and >= implementation
                       * optimize index operation (literal / array) ; indexer should use more optimize algorithm
                       
                       * control operation, if the inline code cannot be implemented,  
                         the expression should be implemented directly?
                       * console entry: probably better to use symbol instead direct call
                       * Compiler::compileMessageDispatch - if only message was changed (with the same parameter) - only
                         message should be changed and resend further
                       * if the class is sealed, any operation with $self should be implemented directly
                       * use stack allocated object for the following code

                       * control run &each &loop should be implemented as virtual loop as well
                       * direct message parameters can be used for the following construction if all the parameters of the second message
                         are constants / locals / fields

                       * review stack allocated data mechanism, think over more light-weight excluding stack mechanism
                       * external call: it should be possible to pass the direct link to the literal string in some cases
                       * idle copyfpi operation (when esp is not changed) , could we find them out and replace with nop?
                       * review stack frames implementation, we could reverse it, e.g. the managed stack ends with -1, the next
                         address is either zero (end of the stack) or the pointer to another managed stack frame
                       * return expression could be compiled without openning / closing frame (if no primitive operations are used, no code blocks)
                       * "copyfpi fp:0" should be implemented as "mov esp, ebp"

                       * should for "expr ? !" on both branches the value is checked (used for the case when the returning value is not bool 
                         - e.g. nil or any other object)
                       * unused code for EException handler after bsredirect (?? should exception be thrown after it)
                       * GC: card table scanning; could we optimize it ?

                       * simplify ansi constants / wideliteral interaction

                         (for long list > 6??)
                       * multiple-select if the type of operands are known try to optimize it ; for example of switch value is constant, maybe
                         better to compare value ?? (if it is true / false constants for example)
                       * could direct parameter allocation be used for open argument list?

              xdev - native code optimization
                       * bssearch : can we get rid of setncb command, if the number is always even?
                       * review bssearch implementation, try to optimize, reduce number of jumps / commands, make them parallel
                       * review commands, try to optimize, reduce number of jumps / commands, make them parallel
                       * review core

week1:
              xdev - x64
                      * think over general architecture
                      * asm2bin64 - compile x64 bit opcodes
                      * create x64 elena vm

week1:
               xdev - GC
                       * destructors

2.0.0
-----
week1:
              xdev - generic development
                       * private class - could we declare one class inside another (so it will be accessible only within its owner)

                       * should code block be called witout the method name e.g. (see Accumulator sample)
                          x eval:3  <-> x:3

                       * switch to xml config files

                       * asm2binx: correctly map parameters with a stack, should frame setting
                         and clearing be preprogrammed?
                       * constant refering to itself in VMT ; currently HOTFIX is implemented ; think over mor elegant way to resolve
                         that type of situation

              xdev - stack allocated variable
                       * long
                       * real
                       * bytearray
              xdev - script engine
                       * refactor / optimize script engine

week2:
              adev - lib30
                       * string concatination: review the current solution, can we simplify it?
                       * $ConsoleReader read &type'widestr &type'length:aLength
                          - currently additional method is used to pass the type of the parameter to external type,
                            local variable with provided type should be used instead:
                                #var(type:widestr) aLiteral := LiteralValue new &type'length:aLength. 
                       * extensions - review the code, can it be simplified?
                       * LiteralValue.add - currently three extra new objects are created, try
                         to optimize
                       * LiteralValue: compiler should optimize the constructor code, e.g. replace
                         the actiual operation with optimized versions for string concatination (without actual object creating
                         or sum operations, if the parameters are primitive types)
                       * consolereader.readchar: review assembler code, try to simplify it
                       * comutator: could commutator be used to modify incoming message subject
                       * TextReader - the current design creates a new literal for each line is read, could we try to reuse it, e.g.
                         convert to another buffer (it will make three of them ???)
                       * TextBuffer: optimize: read, get, delete operations, try to minimize new object creation (using stack allocated
                         objects)                         
                       * pi sample: iteration algorithm, review existing FOR pattern

              xdev - GCX
                       * MT: TLS table should be used to store exception information,
                         rather than global variable like in single thread version
                       * compile as multi-threading stand-alone

                      * display the player score in front of the label
                      * gamemaster should prevent invalid use of joker (for ai)

                      * start to work on tcp/ip connection
                      * could we think over another architecture which allow
                        to optimize the property overriding (at the moment too many
                        proxy objects are created)

          xprj    - gcx
                       * probably better to use already precalculated and rounded
                         (to 32) values for heap size(mg + yg, probably better to have
                         two constants yg_size, mg_size), it will simplify core_init
                         function (no need to calcuate and round sizes)
              idev - debugger
                       * support call list
                       * support thread list
                       * debugger should load appropriate dnl modules for
                         loaded module

--------------------------------
[oooo] Complex System Development:
--------------------------------
 0) Upndown
    - should we disable minimal tramp suit for joker dialog
    - add support for tcp/ip mutli player mode
    - play a basic round with a remote player
    - add possibility to scroll through the score table
    - develop ai player (aggresive, cautious)
    - in ideal solution, game'player'hand'enum may be called only be game master.
      Main form should be able to call it only for its player
   - repeat socket read until temporal buffer is not empty (it is possible
     two simultanius command will be combined on read operation)
   - the game could not be released from the memory if it waiting for the result;
     fix it
   - test if random generator generates actually a random numbers
   - continue move to ELENA: show the card on the table using the mask to make
     cards look oval
   - host panel should display the current IP address
   - the playground background color should be green
   - hide the cards when F5 pressed
   - make not possible to press any key inside edit box of Ordering dialog
   - unsynchronized prepare command could block the program exit (on close of main
     window should class onstop application event)
   - continue move to ELENA: show statistics
   - continue move to ELENA: load / save game
   - on connect make sure that clients and the host use the same program version
   - if makeorder or getcard is failed in gamemaster code it should try to send the
     command once again
   - use original colors
   - disable accept button on start.
   - disable search button after pressing.
   - !! check if frmConnector is destroyed and removed from referencepool
     after game start
   - close all unused connection after the game start
   - use buttons with original glyphs
   - modify the code to make possible any card game
   - use upndown sample as a testbed for the code optimization

-------------------------------
[x] ELENA Language Development:
-------------------------------
    - is there should be special hints to be thread unsafe?

--------------------------
[o] ELENA API Development:
--------------------------
    - work with windows registry
    - make possible to truncate existing files
    - make possible to select system colors / brushes on the gui level
    - fcomip could be used only for pentium
    - make possible to execute another exe?
    - use createcomatibledc for every draw operation looks too expensive;can
      we modify paintboxhandler / imagehandler to do it only once?
    - make sure bitmap / hdc are properly released from the memory
    - for Image / PaintBox handle Paintstruct could be created as local one
      (no need to keep it on class level)
    - modify all float-oriented code to be correct, error handling,
      (should we save the float registers before operations?)
    - 'value' classes should support: min, max, succ, pred (int32value, real64value, ansichar)
    - is it possible to automize the process of data transfer over sockets?
    - database application which manage TODOs and KNOWNBUGs, possible to create
      what's new automatically, statistics
    - optimize insert / delete / copysubs to copy dwords rather then bytes / words
    - automatic code writing / reading from stream
    - optimize implement integer / longinteger modulus implementation in assembelr
    - basic'intnumber / longnumber / real should support method "in" to validate range
    - ext'utilities'Date should contain time in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1900
      rather then in milisecond since January 1, 1970 (UTC)

-----------------------------
[o] ELENA Sample Development:
-----------------------------
     - TextDB sample: load, save, search, add, delete records
     - calcgui should provide the list of calculation - in Listbox -> so we could select previous result
     - calcgui two modes: calculator like and the current one with the list of
       last operations
     - calc: make possible to declare constants
     - continue to work on graph sample: make possible to specify different
       functions, write your own ones, provide scaling and borders
     - new sample - expert system (prolog like sample)
     - new sample - logical game
    - regional time
    - examples to work with FileWriter

-------------------------
[xo] Compiler development:
-------------------------
    - weak references
    - get rid of comment warnings (starting with !!)
    - two compile mode - debug / release (we actually could have two
      sets of sections - with and without debug)
    - compile module only if it was  changed
       - probably we need to always use long jumps for bytecode jump command, it will
         simplify JIT compiler code
       - local properties
       - empty methods
       - methods which returns constant
       - cosntant collections / groups / casts
       - optimize group / annex routine
       - shl / shr commands considered to be not optimal
       - if inline object depends only on its class it should be created only once
         and saved as a hidden object field
       - support linker map option
       - super variable could lead to unexpected behaviour if we use dynamic mutation
         (after super self variable becomes $self one)
       - support strong references (both protected messages and classes), linker
         should check if they are valid
       - Remoting

       - make strong link to the parent class? (!!)
       - make possible to change basic linker options (opImageBase, and so on)
       - look like opGCHeapSize and opSizeOfHeapCommit are connected with each other
       - should codeBase is always 0x1000?; maybe should be customized (see !!
         remark in linker)
       - writeNtHeader: stack size and similar parameters is constant; maybe should
         be possible to customize (see !! remark in linker)
       - support resources in exe file
       - could we minimize the number of entries in call stack (direct return
         from any handler to the called code?)

       - try to optimize the parser table (less number of symbols)
       - inline classes can be created at the first reference to it and exists
         until the next GC call.
       - localization
       - support the following types of unicode source files:little endian, UTF-8?
       - new option target CPU: 386 / 686
       - add new coder: 686Coder whic override x86Coder
       - optimize the most critical code parts like send / redirect / cast routines
         using pentium commands
       - get rid of wait command for float-base operations?

       - try to use pairing instructions
       - we do not need to check for 'mg -> yg conflict' for newly created
         objects
       - MMX, SSE, SSE2 commands; could we start to use these commands?
       - PREFETCH command could be useful
       - compiler option which specifies the target CPU
    - relative fixup works incorrectly if the reference has an offset
    - check if Terminal is nsNone and generates the exception
    - optimize hash table filling for Linker tables

    - optimize the code using profiler
    - check for memory leaking (either profiler or simple check on the start
      and on the finish)
    - optimize hash table filling for ParserTable
    - check for all invalid / valid combination (russia characters)
    - check the debugger behavior in the case of system exception
      (does event EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occur in this case);

--------------------
[o] IDE development:
--------------------
    - should search history be saved, where (in the project / ide config / and so on)
    - implements new features: quick short cut
    - review known bugs
    - improve debugger
    - create simple version of ELENA Code Wizard which add new menu item
    - continue localization
    - give more useful error message if forward symbol is not declared
    - raise an exception if debug module not found by debug controller
    - debugger should use engine's LibraryManager
    - review and refactor elc output redirect routine
    - move fast short cut to autoform plugin
    - show the list of possible messages
    - auto add shortcuts
    - clear keyboard buffer before the program run
    - auto trim for tailing whitespaces (space and tab) - the idea is not to save
      whitespace until the user not to insert any character
    - open all recent files
    - option to ignore unresolved references warning within the project namespace
    - display current file encoding in the status bar
    - ctrl+F8 go to the next statement
    - call stack window
    - investigate stepping over / into annex inline symbols (e.g. $createHandle)
    - prevent from slowing down on the program exit (make possible to inidicate
      to the sistem that this step is the last in the program)
    - optimize debugger step collection access (use some kind of hash table,
      divide the code range into several bands and before direct search use
      it to narrow collection)
    - we do not need stop over inline symbols (except at the symbol beginning)
    - try to deal with the slowing debugger when it goes through the window
      system code in trap mode (e.g. in case of failed method in GUI application
      which terminates the application - is it correct?)
      (try to use breakpoint for any external code call to skip the step mode
      inside external written code - in fact no sense to do it)
    - gui applications are not released from the memory after debugging
    - test Undo / Redo operations for the small capacity (~40 or 50);
    - test operations with tab both virtual and real;
    - refactor dialogs module
    - too many duplicate code in editframe (toLowercase, toUpperCase, trim and
      so on), could we get rid of it?
    - maybe use CP_OEMCP then CP_ACP?
    - optimize (Styler)
    - check if window child created handles are destroyed (destroy method)
    - try to use DFA class for IDE sourcedoc class
    - possible problem when coping ascii text through clipboad - test with russian text
    - undo in overwrite mode works a bit strange
    - why if we have an error we do not see the warnings in messages window?
    - Plugins - and display message when selected
    - highlight the current line
    - new ide settings dialog: autocomp
    - debug watch should be able to display the longest possible identifer
      with the longest possible type e.g. IDENTIFIER_LEN * 2
    - show escape symbols
    - should not be possible close / open / compile project during debug -
      either break the debug or stop the operation
    - debugwatch should indicate if the object plays a role (shifted mode)
    - convert encoding routines
    - make possible not to load some source files (to simplify the debugging)
    - before start debugging make sure debug module is up to date
    - indent / outdent should align the selected code rather then simply
      move it (like in VS IDE)
    - find out optimal page size / history buffer capacity
    - tune up horizontal and vertical scrollers (like it's done in NP++)
    - set read only (?)
    - hide status bar (?)
    - display correct messages when the project is not compiled (missing
      exe / source files)
    - save the last active document / cursor position (?)
    - shows the number of warnings
    - source code assisten plug-in written with ELENA
    - configurable styles: colors / fonts
    - Outlining
    - Class Wizard
    - Auto complete?
    - Code patterns?
    - Message dictionary
    - error recovering (several errors)
    - make possible to change all tabs to spaces
    - code patterns like in VS (type short cut and press tab-tab)
    - Print
    - add Add Watch menu option
    - full screen mode
    - "find in files" function
    - Two editor panels like in NPP
    - clone current view
    - macros
    - autoformat
    - zoom in / zoom out
    - try to bring as much functionality as in notepad++
    - an icon on tab page?
    - make possible to treat the object as an array of bytes
    - make sure in the case of crash saveAllAsDraft and saveSettings are called
    - should we add the path to the recent history right after the project
      was open (or save the project even the program is crashed)
    - try to minimize the number of repaint (after pressing F8 repaint is invoked
      two times instead of one)
    - introduce project templates (with basic forwards)
    - make possible not to close the console window after the program finishing
    - add the editor option controlling this feature
    - tips?
    - new short-cut to got to message / output window
    - remove the code to import old style project file (project\projecttype)
    - why we create the string every time in EditFrame::paint function?

[oo] Cross-platform support:
--------------------------
   - create IDE for Linux
   - create compiler for Linux
    - start to port the code to Linux: compilator
    - start to port the code to Linux: linker
    - resolve all postponed linux oriented issues (!! todo:linux)
    - at the moment on every cursor blink the whole screen is redrawn, think over
      optimization
