week1:
              xdev - exception handling
                       * Exception handler overhaul : either callcontext (stack + $self) should be somehow passed to the object where it
                         is created or in catch handler - forming group with the exception object ; in the first case - how could we
                         create light weight exception - like - method not found

                       * call stack : using ebp it is possible to reconstruct call stack - how to get the call context - method name + call
                         coordinate - load dm module - looking throug the code to find out the procedure name

                       * Review exception handling mechanism : how to provide the exception parameters and the exception call stack
                                              
                       * exception handling : parse catch statements to recognize the exception handler with out need to create a special
                         handler, only if the event was not recognized should we implement it

                       * Exception object should generate the exception info on 

                       * exceptions : provide call stack info

                       * aCatchBlock if::$self | if &MethodNotFoundError...   -  in that case any method not found error inside exception handler raises 
                         the same error -> probably aCatchBlock if::$self || raise:$self should be used ; where || check if the method supports the message
                         if not - goes to the alternative branch (what about dynamic objects in that case)

                       * method not found event should provides the way to specify the object where the method was not found

              xdev - generic development                                                      
                       * calling the parent constructor ?? (see system'io'StreamReader (output should be created in the parent class), Exceptions and so on)

                       * could it be possible for several classes supporting literal type??

                       * should index allocateing / referring / releasing be done as commands ; review reference table design , could it be done
                         differently ? optimize current implementation

                       * for type wrapper - should not be possible to return $self without boxing??? (because it may break the code if
                         not correctly programmed)
                       * review problematic implementation:loop breaking, loop implementation (especially until loop)
                       * default construtor : there should be way to call it explicitly (especially for dynamic one where we need to provide
                         the length parameter, sometimes it should be possible to make some operation with it before passing to default one, see
                         for example LiteralValue - length should be increaded by one)
                       * constructor : should be possible to call base / another constructor

                       * generic method - should be possible to refer the original subject??

                       * see gameoflife : implement template support : all append&xxx looks a like, can we generalize them?                                                    

                       * think over reflection implementtion for static linked executable

                       * should commands be multy-thread independent, e.g. all related code be located in core?
                       * MemoryWriter::writeWideLiteral(char) - invalid code, it should be possible that the sub string ends inside char group,
                         so the actualy read size should be reduced to match the valid group
                       * get rid of predefined constant classes (intnumber, ...)
                       * make possible to use custom types in compileExternalCall (to pass structures), so we could get rid of built-in subject handle

                       * okFieldAddress : it should be possible to have several primitive fields - the value should be copied to stack allocated
                         object if offset is not zero

                       * #throw should generate stack call list, #break will raise an exception without it

                       * exception handling, if the handler does not react on the current exception for ifFailed&on call - different error is thrown
                         (NotFound) and the original exception is lost

                       * if more than 15 parameters passed - use open argument list

                       * ShortNumber.get&int - could we simplify the code, currently we have to call int explicitly because IntNumber is not yet defined

                       * lambda expression : try to implement as a constant / object (without creating a new class every time)                       

                       * if predefined operator implementation is used - no need to typecast the result of branching / looping optimization / inverting
                         - implicitly sepcify that the result is bool

                       * if typed parameter is used no need to typecast (see true.equal&bool)
                       * should numeric constant always be compatible with int types (e.g. with handle)??

                       * any type casting get method call should be implemented as typecast - see system'literalConvertor convert &int:$self literal

                       * for defined types get'type operation should be replaced with typecasting ?? (e.g. try to read the result type before invoking
                         message call)
                       * messages should start with 0x80000000 for windows and from 0xC000000 for linux or always with 0xC0000000 ?
                       * compileMessageParameter : no need to pass count as a reference, it can be increased in compilemessageparameters as well
                       * direct message parameters can be used for the following construction if all the parameters of the second message
                         are constants / locals / fields

                       * jump to another jump should be replaced by a single
                         jump

          xprj    - x project phase4:
                       * safe points: in method entry (??), is it enough to have
                         them in external call and loop?

                      * switch to gtkmm
                      * remove unused code in gtkideconst.h (and the file itself if it
                        is empty)

                      * source file including / excluding
                      * context menu
                      * editor settings
                      * turn on / off syntax highlight
                      * onTabSizeChange should be called for every document after tab
                        size is changed

              fdev - gameplay
                      * network game
                      * make possible to hide / open table (so the form is expanded
                        shrinked)
                      * display the player score in front of the label
                      * gamemaster should prevent invalid use of joker (for ai)
                      * play the longest possible game (two players)
                      * there are too many duplicate code, doing actually the same
                        passing the event, probably one generic method is required;
                        think over how to reuse as much as possible
                      * play game with reduced memory size to watch possible
                        data leaks
                      * remove temporal code from core primitives
                      * check why the game is crashed time to time

                      * do not display joker dialog on trumpless stage
                      * test game with two, three, four players
                      * start to work on tcp/ip connection
                      * could we think over another architecture which allow
                        to optimize the property overriding (at the moment too many
                        proxy objects are created)

            imaint - linux ide2
                       * find out there are two columns instead of one in
                         the search dialog comboboxes
                       * cursor function is called when the window is closing
                       * the current doc in window list should be marked
                       * after several ctrl+tab ide hung up
                       * ctrl+shift+tab doesn't work
                       * test syntax highlighting
                       * fix warning:no scrollable widget
          xprj    - gcx
                       * probably better to use already precalculated and rounded
                         (to 32) values for heap size(mg + yg, probably better to have
                         two constants yg_size, mg_size), it will simplify core_init
                         function (no need to calcuate and round sizes)
              idev - debugger
                       * support call list
                       * support thread list
                       * debugger should load appropriate dnl modules for
                         loaded module
                       * warn if source code is not found by debug controller
            xmaint - usability
                       * make sure that collection class is not a structure

--------------------------------
[oooo] Complex System Development:
--------------------------------
 0) Upndown
    - should we disable minimal tramp suit for joker dialog
    - add support for tcp/ip mutli player mode
    - play a basic round with a remote player
    - add possibility to scroll through the score table
    - develop ai player (aggresive, cautious)
    - in ideal solution, game'player'hand'enum may be called only be game master.
      Main form should be able to call it only for its player
   - repeat socket read until temporal buffer is not empty (it is possible
     two simultanius command will be combined on read operation)
   - the game could not be released from the memory if it waiting for the result;
     fix it
   - test if random generator generates actually a random numbers
   - continue move to ELENA: show the card on the table using the mask to make
     cards look oval
   - host panel should display the current IP address
   - the playground background color should be green
   - hide the cards when F5 pressed
   - make not possible to press any key inside edit box of Ordering dialog
   - unsynchronized prepare command could block the program exit (on close of main
     window should class onstop application event)
   - continue move to ELENA: show statistics
   - continue move to ELENA: load / save game
   - on connect make sure that clients and the host use the same program version
   - if makeorder or getcard is failed in gamemaster code it should try to send the
     command once again
   - use original colors
   - disable accept button on start.
   - disable search button after pressing.
   - !! check if frmConnector is destroyed and removed from referencepool
     after game start
   - close all unused connection after the game start
   - use buttons with original glyphs
   - modify the code to make possible any card game
   - use upndown sample as a testbed for the code optimization

-------------------------------
[x] ELENA Language Development:
-------------------------------
    - is there should be special hints to be thread unsafe?

--------------------------
[o] ELENA API Development:
--------------------------
    - work with windows registry
    - make possible to truncate existing files
    - make possible to select system colors / brushes on the gui level
    - fcomip could be used only for pentium
    - make possible to execute another exe?
    - use createcomatibledc for every draw operation looks too expensive;can
      we modify paintboxhandler / imagehandler to do it only once?
    - make sure bitmap / hdc are properly released from the memory
    - for Image / PaintBox handle Paintstruct could be created as local one
      (no need to keep it on class level)
    - modify all float-oriented code to be correct, error handling,
      (should we save the float registers before operations?)
    - 'value' classes should support: min, max, succ, pred (int32value, real64value, ansichar)
    - is it possible to automize the process of data transfer over sockets?
    - database application which manage TODOs and KNOWNBUGs, possible to create
      what's new automatically, statistics
    - optimize insert / delete / copysubs to copy dwords rather then bytes / words
    - automatic code writing / reading from stream
    - optimize implement integer / longinteger modulus implementation in assembelr
    - basic'intnumber / longnumber / real should support method "in" to validate range
    - ext'utilities'Date should contain time in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1900
      rather then in milisecond since January 1, 1970 (UTC)

-----------------------------
[o] ELENA Sample Development:
-----------------------------
     - TextDB sample: load, save, search, add, delete records
     - calcgui should provide the list of calculation - in Listbox -> so we could select previous result
     - calcgui two modes: calculator like and the current one with the list of
       last operations
     - calc: make possible to declare constants
     - continue to work on graph sample: make possible to specify different
       functions, write your own ones, provide scaling and borders
     - new sample - expert system (prolog like sample)
     - new sample - logical game
    - regional time
    - examples to work with FileWriter

-------------------------
[xo] Compiler development:
-------------------------
    - weak references
    - get rid of comment warnings (starting with !!)
    - two compile mode - debug / release (we actually could have two
      sets of sections - with and without debug)
    - compile module only if it was  changed
       - probably we need to always use long jumps for bytecode jump command, it will
         simplify JIT compiler code
       - empty methods
       - methods which returns constant
       - cosntant collections / groups / casts
       - optimize group / annex routine
       - shl / shr commands considered to be not optimal
       - if inline object depends only on its class it should be created only once
         and saved as a hidden object field
       - support linker map option
       - super variable could lead to unexpected behaviour if we use dynamic mutation
         (after super self variable becomes $self one)
       - support strong references (both protected messages and classes), linker
         should check if they are valid
       - Remoting

       - make strong link to the parent class? (!!)
       - make possible to change basic linker options (opImageBase, and so on)
       - look like opGCHeapSize and opSizeOfHeapCommit are connected with each other
       - should codeBase is always 0x1000?; maybe should be customized (see !!
         remark in linker)
       - writeNtHeader: stack size and similar parameters is constant; maybe should
         be possible to customize (see !! remark in linker)
       - support resources in exe file

       - try to optimize the parser table (less number of symbols)
       - inline classes can be created at the first reference to it and exists
         until the next GC call.
       - localization
       - support the following types of unicode source files:little endian, UTF-8?
       - new option target CPU: 386 / 686
       - add new coder: 686Coder whic override x86Coder
       - optimize the most critical code parts like send / redirect / cast routines
         using pentium commands
       - get rid of wait command for float-base operations?

       - try to use pairing instructions
       - we do not need to check for 'mg -> yg conflict' for newly created
         objects
       - MMX, SSE, SSE2 commands; could we start to use these commands?
       - PREFETCH command could be useful
       - compiler option which specifies the target CPU
    - relative fixup works incorrectly if the reference has an offset
    - check if Terminal is nsNone and generates the exception
    - optimize hash table filling for Linker tables

    - optimize the code using profiler
    - check for memory leaking (either profiler or simple check on the start
      and on the finish)
    - optimize hash table filling for ParserTable
    - check for all invalid / valid combination (russia characters)
    - check the debugger behavior in the case of system exception
      (does event EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occur in this case);

--------------------
[o] IDE development:
--------------------
    - should search history be saved, where (in the project / ide config / and so on)
    - implements new features: quick short cut
    - review known bugs
    - improve debugger
    - create simple version of ELENA Code Wizard which add new menu item
    - continue localization
    - give more useful error message if forward symbol is not declared
    - raise an exception if debug module not found by debug controller
    - debugger should use engine's LibraryManager
    - review and refactor elc output redirect routine
    - move fast short cut to autoform plugin
    - show the list of possible messages
    - auto add shortcuts
    - clear keyboard buffer before the program run
    - auto trim for tailing whitespaces (space and tab) - the idea is not to save
      whitespace until the user not to insert any character
    - open all recent files
    - option to ignore unresolved references warning within the project namespace
    - display current file encoding in the status bar
    - ctrl+F8 go to the next statement
    - call stack window
    - investigate stepping over / into annex inline symbols (e.g. $createHandle)
    - prevent from slowing down on the program exit (make possible to inidicate
      to the sistem that this step is the last in the program)
    - optimize debugger step collection access (use some kind of hash table,
      divide the code range into several bands and before direct search use
      it to narrow collection)
    - we do not need stop over inline symbols (except at the symbol beginning)
    - try to deal with the slowing debugger when it goes through the window
      system code in trap mode (e.g. in case of failed method in GUI application
      which terminates the application - is it correct?)
      (try to use breakpoint for any external code call to skip the step mode
      inside external written code - in fact no sense to do it)
    - gui applications are not released from the memory after debugging
    - test Undo / Redo operations for the small capacity (~40 or 50);
    - test operations with tab both virtual and real;
    - refactor dialogs module
    - too many duplicate code in editframe (toLowercase, toUpperCase, trim and
      so on), could we get rid of it?
    - maybe use CP_OEMCP then CP_ACP?
    - optimize (Styler)
    - check if window child created handles are destroyed (destroy method)
    - try to use DFA class for IDE sourcedoc class
    - possible problem when coping ascii text through clipboad - test with russian text
    - undo in overwrite mode works a bit strange
    - why if we have an error we do not see the warnings in messages window?
    - Plugins - and display message when selected
    - highlight the current line
    - new ide settings dialog: autocomp
    - debug watch should be able to display the longest possible identifer
      with the longest possible type e.g. IDENTIFIER_LEN * 2
    - show escape symbols
    - should not be possible close / open / compile project during debug -
      either break the debug or stop the operation
    - debugwatch should indicate if the object plays a role (shifted mode)
    - convert encoding routines
    - make possible not to load some source files (to simplify the debugging)
    - before start debugging make sure debug module is up to date
    - indent / outdent should align the selected code rather then simply
      move it (like in VS IDE)
    - find out optimal page size / history buffer capacity
    - tune up horizontal and vertical scrollers (like it's done in NP++)
    - set read only (?)
    - hide status bar (?)
    - display correct messages when the project is not compiled (missing
      exe / source files)
    - save the last active document / cursor position (?)
    - shows the number of warnings
    - source code assisten plug-in written with ELENA
    - configurable styles: colors / fonts
    - Outlining
    - Class Wizard
    - Auto complete?
    - Code patterns?
    - Message dictionary
    - error recovering (several errors)
    - make possible to change all tabs to spaces
    - code patterns like in VS (type short cut and press tab-tab)
    - Print
    - add Add Watch menu option
    - full screen mode
    - "find in files" function
    - Two editor panels like in NPP
    - clone current view
    - macros
    - autoformat
    - zoom in / zoom out
    - try to bring as much functionality as in notepad++
    - an icon on tab page?
    - make possible to treat the object as an array of bytes
    - make sure in the case of crash saveAllAsDraft and saveSettings are called
    - should we add the path to the recent history right after the project
      was open (or save the project even the program is crashed)
    - try to minimize the number of repaint (after pressing F8 repaint is invoked
      two times instead of one)
    - introduce project templates (with basic forwards)
    - make possible not to close the console window after the program finishing
    - add the editor option controlling this feature
    - tips?
    - new short-cut to got to message / output window
    - remove the code to import old style project file (project\projecttype)
    - why we create the string every time in EditFrame::paint function?
