------                                 
Currently:
------
              srev - migration
                       * migrate all samples
                       * migrate rosetta samples
                       * migrate tape sample
                       * migrate mt test

              xdev - generic development       
                       * for defined types get'type operation should be replaced with typecasting ?? (e.g. try to read the result type before invoking
                         message call)

                       * for some operation can we somehow to define the output result : e.g. insert&index&literal or toLiteral, so no need to
                         type cast every time the method is called??

                       * recognize literal / int constant ; e.g. extensions'text'Bookmark#class.new

                       * redesign script support
                         
                       * classOp, indexable, enumarable should be declared as extensions

                       * can we use ^ operator to returns from any part of the code to the end
                       
                       * fix debugger to correctly show $self
                       * fix debugger to correctly show stack allocated objects
                       * fix debugger to correctly show arrays
                       
                       * simplify primitive loop implementing

                       * review verb list, probably it should be reduced

                       * optimize ByteCodeWriter::newObject - implement axsetr r ???
                       
                       * test if console.readChar return correct code
                                                                                                
                       * uncomment bcwriter::saveObject - okLocalAddress
                       * uncomment : bcwriter::doGenericHandler / declareGenericMethod / dispatchVerb / jumpIfNotEqualN

                       * boxing the result of external call
                       
                       * any type casting get method call should be implemented as typecast - see system'literalConvertor convert &int:$self literal
                       
                       * module system should be inclduded automatically ??
                       
                       * test all samples

                       * multiple parameter dispatching
                             save&to => save&int&to | save&long&to ; 
                             can we simplify the following syntax : self~(Dispatcher(%int,%(int&to),%long,%(long&to) eval::sour) save:sour:dest.


                             self~({ int : n = %(int&to). long : n = %(long&to). } eval::sour ) eval:sour:dest
                             

                             controlEx dispatch:x:y &table:(%int,%(int&to),%long,%(long&to))

                       * add multiply dispatch test

                       * optimize output code: system'true - nested classes should be sealed, so an operation to itself (or resend) should be
                         resolved in compile-time

                             
                       * implement dispatching with several parameters
                         (see Compiler::compileDispatcher)              

                       * custom verb dispatching (see for example stringControl split&by[2])
                           : intNumber.shift ; stringControl

                       * do we need bseval? direct operation with dll is better
                       
                       * widechar constant : special symbol or we could use literal constant with length=1

                       * lambda expression : try to implement as a constant / object (without creating a new class every time)                       

                       * uncomment commentFrame
                       * remove all commented code

                       * generic handlers : make possible to use passed subject
                       * generic handlers : resend handler - if no match found call the super handler
                       * generic handlers : should not be allowed for roles ??
                       * extender : if no match found call the super handler

                       * stack allocated byte array: it should be possible to provide size in hex code

                       * for type wrapper - should not be possible to return $self without boxing??? (because it may break the code if
                         not correctly programmed)

                       * raise an error if method not found for type wrapper

                       * if predefined operator implementation is used - no need to typecast the result of branching / looping optimization / inverting
                         - implicitly sepcify that the result is bool

                       * if typed parameter is used no need to typecast (see true.equal&bool)
                                                                                                       
                       * should numeric constant always be compatible with int types (e.g. with handle)??

                       * make sure direct operation is called for intconstant, longcontant, literalconstant

                       * structure field cannot be passed as out parameter
                       
                       * 0r should be correct real constant
                       
                       *  in the following code throw is executed twice
                          #symbol XTest =
                          [
                              #var(type:int)n := 2.
    
                              n error.
                          ].

                       * probably we have to caching type wrapper, so no need to load every time

                       * review problematic implementation: constructor (for example Tape and Struct both have to define default constructor),  
                         loop breaking, return operator, exception handling, loop implementation (especially until loop)

                       * review super ecode: bbox, ...

                       * review loop code (see system'io'$ConsoleReader) :
                             #loop
                             [
                                 ...        
                                 continue   // -- should be correctly loaded into accumulator
                             ].
                                                                                                                             
                       * aCatchBlock if::$self | if &MethodNotFoundError...   -  in that case any method not found error inside exception handler raises 
                         the same error -> probably aCatchBlock if::$self || raise:$self should be used ; where || check if the method supports the message
                         if not - goes to the alternative branch (what about dynamic objects in that case)

                       * rename / refactor weval - misleading name

                       * inline'handle_tape: - test the message with argument list

                       * test mttest (find out why debugger cannot debug it correctly)

week1:
              xdev - hotfix : unicode
                       * u_helloworld does not show russian text correctly in just installed IDE
                       * problem with compiling the text with national letters

              xdev - linux
                       * paths: lib    - \usr\share\elena\lib30

                       * linux - build system libraris
                       * linux linker
                       * linux console operations
                       * linux file operations
                       * linux date / time operations
                       * port elc to linux

                       * port elenasm to linux
                       * port elt to linux

              xdev - multithreading       
                       * threadhandle - provide safe region like it was in 1.7
                       * threadhandle - remove the object from the reference table on closing
                       * reference table should be created on the program start for multy thread version
                       * implement lock / unlock
                       * thread table contains reference to the thread TLS, it looks unsafe if the system reallocate the
                         storage ; maybe better to store there data duplication? 
                       * should the lock field copied as well during the object reallocating? (see core_mt'reallocate)
                       * static object should be thread safe
                       * architecture overview ; tls allocated for every thread and accessed by  FS:[2Ch] ; thread enumeration
                       * reimplement thread safe variable, safe points, safe regions
                       * elenavm : support multithreading, either use explicit or implicit TLS allocation
                       * compile pi with mt
                       * compile anagram with mt

              xdev - message ids
                       * messages should start with 0x80000000 for windows and from 0xC000000 for linux or always with 0xC0000000 ?

              xdev - open arg                                      
                       * a msg::Args -> converting open arg list into normal one, when direct message parameter saving is not possible
                         raise an error ; do we need it?
                         
              xdev - general implementation
                       * msaveparams consumes the stack, the stack change is not correctly calculated 
                       * external call: stack should be excluded only if the method is marked as threadsafe
                       * we do not need to store the previous gc_ext_stack_frame, it should be done in open / close frame routine

              xdev - byte code optimization                               
                       * use optimization to optimize constant operations, operations with constant:
                             2+3, a + 2, a << 3, a@2

                       * optimize output code: system'object
                       
                       * redesign frame optimization: do we really need it, or better to use optimization rules

                       * any other operation should result in boxing
                       * simplify primitive byte array allocating (store the size directly during space allocating)
                       
                       * class class symbol should be called directly for private classes as well

                       * optimize : = constant
                       * optimize : = $self
                       * optimize - operation with nil (==, !=)

                       * optimize output code: system'object...

                       * if the target is stack allocated, no need to allocate extra space (at least for the single operation)? 

                       * we do not need frame in idle LiteralValue constructor             

                       * review and optimize dispatching algorithm: $self, field, symbol

                       * optimize length virtual operation implementation (we do not need to save it in the stack)

                       * for loop: review for implementation algorithm can we simplify it??
                       
                       * simplify int / long unboxing

                       * can we simplify "exclude reserve n include" with "excluden n"                       

                       * stack allocated variable - try to minimize the overhead
                       
                       * compileMessageParameter : no need to pass count as a reference, it can be increased in compilemessageparameters as well

                       * review / optimize stack allocating implementing
                       
                       * review ws_insert function (in assembler), try to simplify it

                       * control run &while &loop - support block code as a while parameter

                       * control run &while should be implemented as virtual loop as well

                       * if the method code works only with method parameters - we do not need frame
                       
                       * win32_console: use primtive type'length instead of type'int to pass the length without creating an integer object

                       * bsredirect: could the number of entries always be even, so no need to take this into acount?
                       
                       * action symbol - every action symbol should be implement as
                         symbolloader ? (it is streight forward implementation for stateless, but if the action cotains the outer
                         links)

                       * compiler should replace and:action / and in virtual statement with
                         appropriate inline code

                       * it should be possible to turn off control virtualization, direct calls, optimization code, jumps

                       * elc api: optimize core_api'save_widestr
                       * optimize control run & while virtual implementation

                       * operator optimization: to avoid scanning the whole VMT, operator invoke
                         code could try to search first several entries before going to full search                                      

                       * optimized switch statement implementation (e.g. ordered ??)                       
                       
                       * virtual control.do(1) implementation ; support break exception

                       * if $self is not used - we should not use pushb bcopya / popb, if only paremeters are used, we could skip frame operation

                       * optimize !=, <= and >= implementation
                       * optimize index operation (literal / array) ; indexer should use more optimize algorithm
                       
                       * control operation, if the inline code cannot be implemented,  
                         the expression should be implemented directly?
                       * console entry: probably better to use symbol instead direct call
                       * Compiler::compileMessageDispatch - if only message was changed (with the same parameter) - only
                         message should be changed and resend further
                       * use stack allocated object for the following code                            
                              theIndex less &type'length::theLiteral  - we do not now theLiteral "type", how could we fix it?
                       * control run &each &loop should be implemented as virtual loop as well
                       * direct message parameters can be used for the following construction if all the parameters of the second message
                         are constants / locals / fields  
                               presenterClassFactory new::anObject new:anObject &radix:aRadix.
                         
                       * review stack allocated data mechanism, think over more light-weight excluding stack mechanism
                       * idle copyfpi operation (when esp is not changed) , could we find them out and replace with nop?
                       * return expression could be compiled without openning / closing frame (if no primitive operations are used, no code blocks)
                       * "copyfpi fp:0" should be implemented as "mov esp, ebp"

                       * should for "expr ? !" on both branches the value is checked (used for the case when the returning value is not bool 
                         - e.g. nil or any other object)
                       * unused code for EException handler after bsredirect (?? should exception be thrown after it)
                       * GC: card table scanning; could we optimize it ?

                       * simplify ansi constants / wideliteral interaction
                       
                       * pi (3106)

                       * maybe replace { push 0 }n-times, with lea esp, [esp+n], xor ebx, ebx @loop: mov [esi], ebx, sub ecx, 1, jnz @loop
                         (for long list > 6??)
                       * multiple-select if the type of operands are known try to optimize it ; for example of switch value is constant, maybe
                         better to compare value ?? (if it is true / false constants for example)
                       * could direct parameter allocation be used for open argument list?
                       * review / simplify idle constructor
                       * boolean inverting opzimizing
                       * filling with zero / nil should be done inside constructor
                       * stack allocated byte array should not be reserved second time
                       * hook: maybe offset should exclude call command size, so no need
                         in adjucment
                       * simplify typecasting should notb be done for operations like length, index
                       * boxing after primtive operation should be done probably directly, i.e. implicitly create an object (int, long or real)
                       * compiler option : switch off jump optimization
                       * compiler option : switch off direct calls
                       * optimize type cast call (dispatch handler should be used) 
                       * external call: maybe in normal case we pass the literal reference directly and for all other cases stack allocated
                         byte array used?
                       * simplify external call
                       * could we somehow store tls table address?
                       * if no calls / GC operation do not use stack frame excluding
                       * if only method parameter is used, no need to use frame / self commands
                       * replace enumeration / iteration loops with a virtual expressions
                       * ByteCodeWriter::checkIfBaseUsed: extension commands should be checked as well 
                       * x : p = p eval. and x : p = p eval:$self. should be optimized
                       * $self operation should be called directly without using redirect handler ?? (see system'routines'EnumerableIndexer)

                       * branching : if the result of the operation is known (e.g. it is predefined operation) - no need to typecast the result
                       * Object.equal[1] - resend operation can be implemented without a new frame
                       * true.and[1] - can resend with dispatch be optimized?
                       * primitive arithmetic / comparision operation with implicit typecasting should be allowed : int vs long, int vs real, long vs real
                       * can we implement #break statement which will not create a breakexception for every call?
                       * optimize comparision operation with nil (see ListEnumerator)

              xdev - native code optimization
                       * optimize hook / unhook commands

                       * should ret be followed with several nops?

                       * starts to use Pentium commands: we need to introduce the mode for
                         i686 (cmov is not supported for older CPU, so we have to have two
                         set of commands)

                       * refresh / reload documents after changing encoding ??
                       * settings / project settings - could we simplify utf-8 <-> utf-16 conversion, maybe settings should store data in
                         utf-16 for windows?
                       * store current encoding for every file

                       * step over #break / #throw does not work correctly
                       * debug loop - should the debugger goes directly to the loop end or better to the loop start (as it was before)

              idev - usability
                       * it should be possible to turn-off deleting compiled modules if one of the project module fails

                       * nested action / function should be reimplemented, Action / Function class should contain the reference to the 
                         code ; what about non constant ones ?

                       * constant array

                         can use direct method call

                         so the actualy read size should be reduced to match the valid group
                       * get rid of predefined constant classes (intnumber, ...)
                       * make possible to use custom types in compileExternalCall (to pass structures), so we could get rid of built-in subject handle

                       * okFieldAddress : it should be possible to have several primitive fields - the value should be copied to stack allocated
                         object if offset is not zero

                       * #throw should generate stack call list, #break will raise an exception without it

                       * exception handling, if the handler does not react on the current exception for ifFailed&on call - different error is thrown
                         (NotFound) and the original exception is lost

                       * if more than 15 parameters passed - use open argument list

                       * extensions - review the code, can it be simplified?
                       * LiteralValue.add - currently three extra new objects are created, try
                         to optimize
                       * consolereader.readchar: review assembler code, try to simplify it
                       * comutator: could commutator be used to modify incoming message subject
                       * TextReader - the current design creates a new literal for each line is read, could we try to reuse it, e.g.
                         convert to another buffer (it will make three of them ???)
                       * TextBuffer: optimize: read, get, delete operations, try to minimize new object creation (using stack allocated
                         objects)                         
                       * pi sample: iteration algorithm, review existing FOR pattern

                      * make possible to hide / open table (so the form is expanded
                        shrinked)
                      * display the player score in front of the label
                      * gamemaster should prevent invalid use of joker (for ai)

                      * start to work on tcp/ip connection
                      * could we think over another architecture which allow
                        to optimize the property overriding (at the moment too many
                        proxy objects are created)

          xprj    - gcx
                       * probably better to use already precalculated and rounded
                         (to 32) values for heap size(mg + yg, probably better to have
                         two constants yg_size, mg_size), it will simplify core_init
                         function (no need to calcuate and round sizes)
              idev - debugger
                       * support call list
                       * support thread list
                       * debugger should load appropriate dnl modules for
                         loaded module
                       * warn if source code is not found by debug controller
            xmaint - usability
                       * make sure that collection class is not a structure

--------------------------------
[oooo] Complex System Development:
--------------------------------
 0) Upndown
    - should we disable minimal tramp suit for joker dialog
    - add support for tcp/ip mutli player mode
    - play a basic round with a remote player
    - add possibility to scroll through the score table
    - develop ai player (aggresive, cautious)
    - in ideal solution, game'player'hand'enum may be called only be game master.
      Main form should be able to call it only for its player
   - repeat socket read until temporal buffer is not empty (it is possible
     two simultanius command will be combined on read operation)
   - the game could not be released from the memory if it waiting for the result;
     fix it
   - test if random generator generates actually a random numbers
   - continue move to ELENA: show the card on the table using the mask to make
     cards look oval
   - host panel should display the current IP address
   - the playground background color should be green
   - hide the cards when F5 pressed
   - make not possible to press any key inside edit box of Ordering dialog
   - unsynchronized prepare command could block the program exit (on close of main
     window should class onstop application event)
   - continue move to ELENA: show statistics
   - continue move to ELENA: load / save game
   - on connect make sure that clients and the host use the same program version
   - if makeorder or getcard is failed in gamemaster code it should try to send the
     command once again
   - use original colors
   - disable accept button on start.
   - disable search button after pressing.
   - !! check if frmConnector is destroyed and removed from referencepool
     after game start
   - close all unused connection after the game start
   - use buttons with original glyphs
   - modify the code to make possible any card game
   - use upndown sample as a testbed for the code optimization

-------------------------------
[x] ELENA Language Development:
-------------------------------
    - is there should be special hints to be thread unsafe?

--------------------------
[o] ELENA API Development:
--------------------------
    - work with windows registry
    - make possible to truncate existing files
    - make possible to select system colors / brushes on the gui level
    - fcomip could be used only for pentium
    - make possible to execute another exe?
    - use createcomatibledc for every draw operation looks too expensive;can
      we modify paintboxhandler / imagehandler to do it only once?
    - make sure bitmap / hdc are properly released from the memory
    - for Image / PaintBox handle Paintstruct could be created as local one
      (no need to keep it on class level)
    - modify all float-oriented code to be correct, error handling,
      (should we save the float registers before operations?)
    - 'value' classes should support: min, max, succ, pred (int32value, real64value, ansichar)
    - is it possible to automize the process of data transfer over sockets?
    - database application which manage TODOs and KNOWNBUGs, possible to create
      what's new automatically, statistics
    - optimize insert / delete / copysubs to copy dwords rather then bytes / words
    - automatic code writing / reading from stream
    - optimize implement integer / longinteger modulus implementation in assembelr
    - basic'intnumber / longnumber / real should support method "in" to validate range
    - ext'utilities'Date should contain time in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1900
      rather then in milisecond since January 1, 1970 (UTC)

-----------------------------
[o] ELENA Sample Development:
-----------------------------
     - TextDB sample: load, save, search, add, delete records
     - calcgui should provide the list of calculation - in Listbox -> so we could select previous result
     - calcgui two modes: calculator like and the current one with the list of
       last operations
     - calc: make possible to declare constants
     - continue to work on graph sample: make possible to specify different
       functions, write your own ones, provide scaling and borders
     - new sample - expert system (prolog like sample)
     - new sample - logical game
    - regional time
    - examples to work with FileWriter

-------------------------
[xo] Compiler development:
-------------------------
    - weak references
    - get rid of comment warnings (starting with !!)
    - two compile mode - debug / release (we actually could have two
      sets of sections - with and without debug)
    - compile module only if it was  changed
       - probably we need to always use long jumps for bytecode jump command, it will
         simplify JIT compiler code
       - empty methods
       - methods which returns constant
       - cosntant collections / groups / casts
       - optimize group / annex routine
       - shl / shr commands considered to be not optimal
       - if inline object depends only on its class it should be created only once
         and saved as a hidden object field
       - support linker map option
       - super variable could lead to unexpected behaviour if we use dynamic mutation
         (after super self variable becomes $self one)
       - support strong references (both protected messages and classes), linker
         should check if they are valid
       - Remoting

       - make strong link to the parent class? (!!)
       - make possible to change basic linker options (opImageBase, and so on)
       - look like opGCHeapSize and opSizeOfHeapCommit are connected with each other
       - should codeBase is always 0x1000?; maybe should be customized (see !!
         remark in linker)
       - writeNtHeader: stack size and similar parameters is constant; maybe should
         be possible to customize (see !! remark in linker)
       - support resources in exe file

       - try to optimize the parser table (less number of symbols)
       - inline classes can be created at the first reference to it and exists
         until the next GC call.
       - localization
       - support the following types of unicode source files:little endian, UTF-8?
       - new option target CPU: 386 / 686
       - add new coder: 686Coder whic override x86Coder
       - optimize the most critical code parts like send / redirect / cast routines
         using pentium commands
       - get rid of wait command for float-base operations?

       - try to use pairing instructions
       - we do not need to check for 'mg -> yg conflict' for newly created
         objects
       - MMX, SSE, SSE2 commands; could we start to use these commands?
       - PREFETCH command could be useful
       - compiler option which specifies the target CPU
    - relative fixup works incorrectly if the reference has an offset
    - check if Terminal is nsNone and generates the exception
    - optimize hash table filling for Linker tables

    - optimize the code using profiler
    - check for memory leaking (either profiler or simple check on the start
      and on the finish)
    - optimize hash table filling for ParserTable
    - check for all invalid / valid combination (russia characters)
    - check the debugger behavior in the case of system exception
      (does event EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occur in this case);

--------------------
[o] IDE development:
--------------------
    - should search history be saved, where (in the project / ide config / and so on)
    - implements new features: quick short cut
    - review known bugs
    - improve debugger
    - create simple version of ELENA Code Wizard which add new menu item
    - continue localization
    - give more useful error message if forward symbol is not declared
    - raise an exception if debug module not found by debug controller
    - debugger should use engine's LibraryManager
    - review and refactor elc output redirect routine
    - move fast short cut to autoform plugin
    - show the list of possible messages
    - auto add shortcuts
    - clear keyboard buffer before the program run
    - auto trim for tailing whitespaces (space and tab) - the idea is not to save
      whitespace until the user not to insert any character
    - open all recent files
    - option to ignore unresolved references warning within the project namespace
    - display current file encoding in the status bar
    - ctrl+F8 go to the next statement
    - call stack window
    - investigate stepping over / into annex inline symbols (e.g. $createHandle)
    - prevent from slowing down on the program exit (make possible to inidicate
      to the sistem that this step is the last in the program)
    - optimize debugger step collection access (use some kind of hash table,
      divide the code range into several bands and before direct search use
      it to narrow collection)
    - we do not need stop over inline symbols (except at the symbol beginning)
    - try to deal with the slowing debugger when it goes through the window
      system code in trap mode (e.g. in case of failed method in GUI application
      which terminates the application - is it correct?)
      (try to use breakpoint for any external code call to skip the step mode
      inside external written code - in fact no sense to do it)
    - gui applications are not released from the memory after debugging
    - test Undo / Redo operations for the small capacity (~40 or 50);
    - test operations with tab both virtual and real;
    - refactor dialogs module
    - too many duplicate code in editframe (toLowercase, toUpperCase, trim and
      so on), could we get rid of it?
    - maybe use CP_OEMCP then CP_ACP?
    - optimize (Styler)
    - check if window child created handles are destroyed (destroy method)
    - try to use DFA class for IDE sourcedoc class
    - possible problem when coping ascii text through clipboad - test with russian text
    - undo in overwrite mode works a bit strange
    - why if we have an error we do not see the warnings in messages window?
    - Plugins - and display message when selected
    - highlight the current line
    - new ide settings dialog: autocomp
    - debug watch should be able to display the longest possible identifer
      with the longest possible type e.g. IDENTIFIER_LEN * 2
    - show escape symbols
    - should not be possible close / open / compile project during debug -
      either break the debug or stop the operation
    - debugwatch should indicate if the object plays a role (shifted mode)
    - convert encoding routines
    - make possible not to load some source files (to simplify the debugging)
    - before start debugging make sure debug module is up to date
    - indent / outdent should align the selected code rather then simply
      move it (like in VS IDE)
    - find out optimal page size / history buffer capacity
    - tune up horizontal and vertical scrollers (like it's done in NP++)
    - set read only (?)
    - hide status bar (?)
    - display correct messages when the project is not compiled (missing
      exe / source files)
    - save the last active document / cursor position (?)
    - shows the number of warnings
    - source code assisten plug-in written with ELENA
    - configurable styles: colors / fonts
    - Outlining
    - Class Wizard
    - Auto complete?
    - Code patterns?
    - Message dictionary
    - error recovering (several errors)
    - make possible to change all tabs to spaces
    - code patterns like in VS (type short cut and press tab-tab)
    - Print
    - add Add Watch menu option
    - full screen mode
    - "find in files" function
    - Two editor panels like in NPP
    - clone current view
    - macros
    - autoformat
    - zoom in / zoom out
    - try to bring as much functionality as in notepad++
    - an icon on tab page?
    - make possible to treat the object as an array of bytes
    - make sure in the case of crash saveAllAsDraft and saveSettings are called
    - should we add the path to the recent history right after the project
      was open (or save the project even the program is crashed)
    - try to minimize the number of repaint (after pressing F8 repaint is invoked
      two times instead of one)
    - introduce project templates (with basic forwards)
    - make possible not to close the console window after the program finishing
    - add the editor option controlling this feature
    - tips?
    - new short-cut to got to message / output window
    - remove the code to import old style project file (project\projecttype)
    - why we create the string every time in EditFrame::paint function?
