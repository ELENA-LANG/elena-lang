                       * sending a typecasting message to %get, leads to dead loop.
                          a add &int:%get. ; possible solution, if the object is used as an temoral mutation, redirect to the target, otherwise
                          as a stand alone object, similar implemetation for verb, signature, message

                       * initializing stack allocated object:
                           #var(type:mssgarray,size:10) properties.

                           may be it should be something like

                           #var(type:mssgarray) properties := MessageArray new &length:10. - how to define the structure size, call the constructor and
                           so on ? probably we could specify the method hint to indicate the default constructor???

                       * there should be a way to convert the object into liner structure ,it should be either predefined - a list of required
                         properties

                       * think over serilizing / deserialing the object

                       * to serilize the object we could ask for all the object properties - 

                       * every time the declared type is used - appropriate constant symbol should be created as well , or it should be created
                         dynamically

                         byte array, can we do it directly?

                       * encoders : make code similar to c#, it should be possible to save literal / wide as
                         bytearray and visa versa (currently we have to convert literal / wide to chararray and then save
                         in appropriate encoding, could we simplify the routine?)

                       * console : default exception handler should write a message

                       * group object : Wrap(a, %Even[ even value ])  - does not work, because get property use dispatch handler, think over
                         another group object - Group (a, %Even[ even value ]), which will works correctly
                       * implement Dispatcher : e.g. self~(Dispatcher(%int,%(int&to),%long,%(long&to) eval::sour) save:sour:dest ; think over the possible use

                         for example)
                       * CharValue: short and char in some form are interdependant, maybe should be synonym as well?
                       
                       * system'intnumber, ... - modify the current implementation for the basic operations should be external , current implementation
                         is not safe , if for some reason the compiler optimization is turned off (replacing operation with the direct action) the code
                         will raise out of stack error
                       * LiteralValue : indexOf&index&out'short and getAt&index&out'short should be moved to primitive object

                       * system'Array : probably getAt&index&out'short  should be implemented
                         in arrayPrimitive like other operations?

                         be implemented in byteArrayPrimitive ?

week 4:
              xmaint - elc
                       * bug : two classes with the same name

              xmaint - web page
                       * update github read me, to provide information how to contibute, getting started, how to build, hot to compile the project, 
                       * update the web page using bootstrap

              xdev - ide
                       * ide : test with utf8, win1252, ...
                       * elc : test with utf8, win1252, ...

              smaint - rosetta samples
                       * fix bestshuffle
                       * bestshuffle : fix the code - abracadabra, baarrcadaab, (0)  in ELENA - 4

              xmaint - package
                       * create installation package
                       * release : compile / copy elenart

              xmaint - scripts
                       * use echo to say what project is compiled, or display this info in tool
                       * if the compilation with an error go to an error label and stop

              imaint - test
                       * debugger does not show the integer value content correctly:
                            #var n := Integer new.
                            #var l := n long.
                         after the second operation it says n content is 20h

              xmaint - elc
                       * update command line option help, a lot of not supported option, show new ones

              xmaint - test
                       * test with cyriclic and chinese names (strings, variables, files2)
                       * test short -> int, int -> short should correctly set sign
                       * test system'io'StreamWriter

                       * test ShortArray operations

                       * consoleReader.read&Line : test with smaller buffer and longer string (to check how it works for large input)
                       
                       * test operation with stack allocated binaray array (write / read / length / getAt)
                       * boxing: message target / operand, operator target / operand
                       * make sure exclude command excludes the stack correctly (e.g. any script sample - GC should happends inside
                         script, so we could check if the caller stack is included correctly)

            smaint - testing
                       * extend realtest with comparision operation test
                       * modify system test, it should raise an exception if any of the tests fails
                       * think over lib30 automatic testing based on script, e.g. write automatic test sequences which can be applied
                         to any object

1.9.20
--------
week1:
              idev - unicode
                       * textview : support chinese symbols - cursor location (chines symbols should take two symbol?)
                       
              xdev - generic development
                       * special hint to prevent the variable from been stack allocated, it means there should be additional check to make sure
                         the variable is stack allocated 

                       * #var(type:vint)n := Integer new.
                         n := 4.  // value should be copied rather than the reference

                       * if the array is declared without size - raise an error?

                       * declaring stack allocated object without providing default value
                          #var(type:int)n.
                          #var(type:bytearray,size:5)fa.

                         stack allocated types should be filled with zeros.

                       * declaring stack allocated object without providing default value                       
                          #var(type:bytearray)fa. - an empty object should be automatically created with 0 length
                          
                       * boxing, if the stack allocated object was boxed after the end of the operation it should be unboxed (if the type is read only - no
                         need in unbox part)
  
                       * direct call method for stack allocated object - only safe one, or should be boxed

                       * boxing not read only stack allocated objects - the dynamic object should copy its content to the original one
                         
                       * declaring variable without assigning a value should be allowed only for stack allocated types , in all other cases we may have
                         nil object referred by strong typed variable
                       * check the operation with nil (as a wrapper around $nil) 
                       
                       * primitive arithmetic operations "+","-","*","/" - the result should be IntNumber

                       * structural types : you may specify the type of sructural class: integer, real, pointer, stringof (integer), subject, message
                         implement primitive operations : + - * / += -= *= /= << == != < > >= <= @ @:= for all possible situations

                       * forms.onPaint : should it be possible somehow to validate if the action can be used for this type??
                       * begin / end should be verbs?
                       * initializing stack allocated variables
                       * fixed sized data array (see system'winforms'PAINTSTRUCT)
                       * free should be method to free the resoures (must be a verb)
                       * typed list ; possible implementation (see forms package)
                       * method redirect to sealed / closed object - should be direct as well ; simplify forms package code using this feature
                         (control adapters could be created directly in the code without need to explicitly declare them) ; otherwise if the call
                         unknown box the variables if reuqired
                       * should it be possible to typecast shortarray as byte array? (for stack allocated ones)
                       * for variable stack allocated object if boxing was made, after the operation end - unboxing should be
                         implemented
                       * wide literal constant
                       * operation with extension should be directly resolved, should boxing be impmenented with a target? anf if
                         not, than the operation with self should be boxed?
                       * probably we should not directly call any coreapi functions, all functionality be implemented as byte codes ?
                       * split hook into two : address , hook ; or use internal function for exception raising / handling?
                       * every action code is a new class, is it possible to design it so no need to create a new class for every sub code?
                         (e.g. reference to the symbol code, known problem : mixing outer field with code reference) 
                       * system'Signature should qualify only generic message with one parameter, there should be flag to indicate if it is strong
                         one or not ; if it is the strong one the object should implicitly send typecasting message to the parameter

                       * private / protected / internal methods / internal type
                       
                       * constant symbols should be sealed / closed ?
                       
                       * it should be possible to call explicitly code declared in system'routine : system'internal'intptr eval &literal:x ...

                       * constructor may return constant objects as well (see min / max)
                       * strong types may have reserved range, so special table will be created - pairing class reference with, or alternatively
                         strong type may be used as message id + subject mask (what about Linux in this case - rdata should be located in 4FFFFFFF range)

                       * critical bug with dynamic signature : signature class should validate strong types - signature code should have
                         reserved bit to indicate it is a strong one, so typecasting should be executed - this will not help with multy subject
                         signature
                       * break the loop
                       * make posible to declare symbol which value can be defined in the project, e.g. constant forward (and typed constant forward)
                       * show / hide should be verbs
                       * stack allocated variable : support dynamic byte array size (when size is not provided) - should be possible to allocate
                         dynamically for external operation
                       * shoud is verb always return boolean?
                       * it should be possible to inizialize stack allocated structure without actually creating the object, 
                         e.g. BaseControl : theRegion := Region new.
                       * operation with $self in normal class is resolved by binaray search. After the class is limited or sealed, such operations
                         could be implemented directly, is there any other way to achieve this without duplicating source code?
                       * think over pattern similar to bool ? value1 : value2
                         
              xdev - general implementation
                       * why : #var anImage := theImages getAt &index:(theIndex int). //#field(type:int)theIndex.

                       * handle access vialation exception : exception handler should be called

                       * should be possible to write  #var(type:vint)Styles := WS_CHILD || BS_AUTORADIOBUTTON. - directly

                       * bug with stack allocated variable in symbol : #static C        = 2.0r / 3.0r.
                       * review graph sample, get rid of warnings

                       * constant symbols should be used directly
                       * should be possible to implement :     #constructor newCompatible &hdc:aCompatible <= new &hdc:(system'external'GDI32 CreateCompatibleDC &hdc:aCompatible).

                       * review all system warnings
                       * WS_CHILD || SS_SIMPLE || WS_VISIBLE should supported (see system'winforms)
                       * HInstance new &hinstance:(system'external'KERNEL32 GetModuleHandleW &int:0), should be implicitly typecasted without warning
                         (e.g. temporal object allocated and valie copied there)
                       * win32 linker : should stat + bss be combined into single section?
                       * probably for arithmetic and referring operation classes should be checked rather than debug flags (i.e. it is not possible
                         to tell apart chararray from shortarray or getAt / setAt will be executed directly for any dynamic array) 
                       * impelement array getat & setat operator
                       * it should be possible to implement primitive operation with shortarray, chararray and bytearray
                       * variable: no need to store nil if the variable statement has initializing part
                       * stack allocated objects : no need to save the reference to it as a normal reference, use okLocalAddress for such case,
                         so boxing mechanism can be simplified
                       * constant array
                       * StreamWriter::writeWideLiteral(char) - invalid code, it should be possible that the sub string ends inside char group,
                         so the actualy read size should be reduced to match the valid group
                       * messages should start with 0x80000000 for windows and from 0xC000000 for linux or always with 0xC0000000 ?
                       * loop should contain snop
                       * external call: stack should be excluded only if the method is marked as threadsafe
                       * reimplement || operator : a msg1 || msg2  - if "a" does not support msg1, msg2 is invoked
                       * try to avoid duplciate checks (for example check for methods / types)
                       * boxing : object saving should be done only if the object was boxed
                       * hook and unhook consume stack, it should be reflected in bytecodewriter::save
                       * probably we have to caching type wrapper, so no need to load every time                      
                       * compileMessageParameter : no need to pass count as a reference, it can be increased in compilemessageparameters as well                       
                       * ModuleScope::getClassType - cache the results to optimize the type retrieving ??
                       * DFA : replace current hotfix with character terminal with correct solution (probably in DFA should be two different states
                         one for single constant #10 and another for several constant or literal + constant - #10#13)
                       * primitive arithmetic / comparision operation with implicit typecasting should be allowed : int vs long, int vs real, long vs real
                       * get rid of ByteCodeWriter::typecast, it should be replaced with pushObject and CallMessage operation                       
                       * literal constant should be converted into utf8 if it is passed as utf8_literal
                       * #var l := 100000000000000l / 5000000000000l. warning the expression may be boxed, should in this case do not use primitive operation?
                       * if more than 11 parameters are passed, open argument list should be used automatically??
                       * system'external'USER32 SetWindowLongW &handle:anHWND &int:GWL_USERDATA &object:$self - it should be possible to pass a constant
                         symbols as an argument
                       * cache type checks
                       * review current primitive stack allocation ; probably primtive variables declared in the sub code,
                         should be freed after the sub code is closed (currently the space is percist to fix the bug with
                         external call (see NOTEs))

                       * implicit variables (allocated for arithmetic or typecasting operations) should not be permanent
                       * if the nested class owner is sealed / limited - direct operation should be used
                       * no need to provide exclude command for every external call, special hint to ignore it?
                       * think over optimized way to get GCXT TLS TABLE, try to cache the pointer
                       * invalid error for the following invalid code : #var(type:int)Styles.

                       * direct call / virtual call : try to eliminate nil check when it is possible, for example, if the compiler
                         detect early type check, when additional ones are not necessary
                       
              xdev - byte code optimization                               
                       * review / optimize SDIApplication.start
                       * call to $super should be direct
                       * direct operations with int constants e.g. $self create &int:(WS_STYLE1 || WS_STYLE2)

                       * optimize ByteCodeWriter::copyStructure                       

                       * anObject cast:%equal &to:$self bool can be compiled directly in reverse order (BaseValue.equal[1])
                       * n := n - $self - should be replaced with direct subtract operation if n is of int type and $self is IntNumber                       
                       * make sure intvar can be passed as int without major overhead (no explicit typecasting)
                       
                       * optimize output code: system'BaseFunction2

                       * reference table should be created on the program start for multy thread version
                       * thread table contains reference to the thread TLS, it looks unsafe if the system reallocate the

                       * settings / project settings - could we simplify utf-8 <-> utf-16 conversion, maybe settings should store data in
                         utf-16 for windows?
                       * chinese (or others two or more UTF8 ) characters should take two columns (similar like tab)

week1:
              xdev - elenavm
                       * should open / close frame override stack_bottom pointer? looks like it is not necessary
                       * elenavm: use reverse instead of set of swaps

              xdev - GC
                       * heap mg size should reserved but not committed and can grow
                       * out of memory exception should be correctly raised
                       * destructors
                       
              xdev - generic development
                       * private class - could we declare one class inside another (so it will be accessible only within its owner)

                       * should code block be called witout the method name e.g. (see Accumulator sample)
                          x eval:3  <-> x:3

                       * switch to xml config files

                       * asm2binx: correctly map parameters with a stack, should frame setting
                         and clearing be preprogrammed?
                       * constant refering to itself in VMT ; currently HOTFIX is implemented ; think over mor elegant way to resolve
                         that type of situation
                       * a lot of operations with intNumber, longNumber and realNumber look
                         alike, can we try to generalize them?
                       * could typed subjects be reserved for every module? So they have the
                         same ids in every module? (so we could get rid of long list of cached
                         values)
                       * to move all the code from core_routines into coreapi, implement coreapi in ecodes, get rid of import statement in the

              xdev - general implementation
                       * message/subject should be constant which is boxed when it is required ??
                       * message reference - could we simply pass the message id (which is always negative, so no problem with GC reference
                         recognition), instead of symbol reference?
                       * e.g. extensions'text'ReaderEnumerator.next

                          (cannot predict that both branches return boolean value, so no need in an extra typecast)

                       * multiple-select if the type of operands are known try to optimize it ; for example of switch value is constant, maybe
                         better to compare value ?? (if it is true / false constants for example)
                       * direct parameter allocation can be used for open argument list : e.g. OpenArgTester testParamsCopy &args:1:"a":3
                       * optimized switch statement implementation (e.g. ordered ??)                       
                       * optimize !=, <= and >= implementation
                       * optimize index operation (literal / array) ; indexer should use more optimize algorithm
                       * compiler should replace and:action / and in virtual statement with
                         appropriate inline code
                       * Compiler::compileMessageDispatch - if only message was changed (with the same parameter) - only
                         message should be changed and resend further

              xdev - native code optimization
                       * optimize hook / unhook commands

                       * review commands : use conditional moving
                       * review core
                       * starts to use Pentium commands: we need to introduce the mode for
                         i686 (cmov is not supported for older CPU, so we have to have two
                         set of commands)
                       * hook: maybe offset should exclude call command size, so no need
                         in adjucment
                       
              xdev - script support

                            local variable with provided type should be used instead:
                                #var(type:widestr) aLiteral := LiteralValue new &type'length:aLength. 
                       * extensions - review the code, can it be simplified?

                       * comutator: could commutator be used to modify incoming message subject
                       * TextReader - the current design creates a new literal for each line is read, could we try to reuse it, e.g.
                         convert to another buffer (it will make three of them ???)
                       * TextBuffer: optimize: read, get, delete operations, try to minimize new object creation (using stack allocated

--------------------------------
[oooo] Complex System Development:
--------------------------------
 0) Upndown
    - should we disable minimal tramp suit for joker dialog
    - add support for tcp/ip mutli player mode
    - play a basic round with a remote player
    - add possibility to scroll through the score table
    - develop ai player (aggresive, cautious)
    - in ideal solution, game'player'hand'enum may be called only be game master.
      Main form should be able to call it only for its player
   - repeat socket read until temporal buffer is not empty (it is possible
     two simultanius command will be combined on read operation)
   - the game could not be released from the memory if it waiting for the result;
     fix it
   - test if random generator generates actually a random numbers
   - continue move to ELENA: show the card on the table using the mask to make
     cards look oval
   - host panel should display the current IP address
   - the playground background color should be green
   - hide the cards when F5 pressed
   - make not possible to press any key inside edit box of Ordering dialog
   - unsynchronized prepare command could block the program exit (on close of main
     window should class onstop application event)
   - continue move to ELENA: show statistics
   - continue move to ELENA: load / save game
   - on connect make sure that clients and the host use the same program version
   - if makeorder or getcard is failed in gamemaster code it should try to send the
     command once again
   - use original colors
   - disable accept button on start.
   - disable search button after pressing.
   - !! check if frmConnector is destroyed and removed from referencepool
     after game start
   - close all unused connection after the game start
   - use buttons with original glyphs
   - modify the code to make possible any card game
   - use upndown sample as a testbed for the code optimization

-------------------------------
[x] ELENA Language Development:
-------------------------------
    - is there should be special hints to be thread unsafe?

--------------------------
[o] ELENA API Development:
--------------------------
    - work with windows registry
    - make possible to truncate existing files
    - make possible to select system colors / brushes on the gui level
    - fcomip could be used only for pentium
    - make possible to execute another exe?
    - use createcomatibledc for every draw operation looks too expensive;can
      we modify paintboxhandler / imagehandler to do it only once?
    - make sure bitmap / hdc are properly released from the memory
    - for Image / PaintBox handle Paintstruct could be created as local one
      (no need to keep it on class level)
    - modify all float-oriented code to be correct, error handling,
      (should we save the float registers before operations?)
    - 'value' classes should support: min, max, succ, pred (int32value, real64value, ansichar)
    - is it possible to automize the process of data transfer over sockets?
    - database application which manage TODOs and KNOWNBUGs, possible to create
      what's new automatically, statistics
    - automatic code writing / reading from stream
    - optimize implement integer / longinteger modulus implementation in assembelr
    - basic'intnumber / longnumber / real should support method "in" to validate range
    - ext'utilities'Date should contain time in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1900
      rather then in milisecond since January 1, 1970 (UTC)

-----------------------------
[o] ELENA Sample Development:
-----------------------------
     - TextDB sample: load, save, search, add, delete records
     - calcgui should provide the list of calculation - in Listbox -> so we could select previous result
     - calcgui two modes: calculator like and the current one with the list of
       last operations
     - calc: make possible to declare constants
     - continue to work on graph sample: make possible to specify different
       functions, write your own ones, provide scaling and borders
     - new sample - expert system (prolog like sample)
     - new sample - logical game
    - regional time
    - examples to work with FileWriter

-------------------------
[xo] Compiler development:
-------------------------
    - weak references
    - get rid of comment warnings (starting with !!)
    - two compile mode - debug / release (we actually could have two
      sets of sections - with and without debug)
    - compile module only if it was  changed
       - probably we need to always use long jumps for bytecode jump command, it will
         simplify JIT compiler code
       - cosntant collections / groups / casts
       - optimize group / annex routine
       - shl / shr commands considered to be not optimal
       - if inline object depends only on its class it should be created only once
         and saved as a hidden object field
       - support linker map option
       - super variable could lead to unexpected behaviour if we use dynamic mutation
         (after super self variable becomes $self one)
       - support strong references (both protected messages and classes), linker
         should check if they are valid
       - Remoting

       - make strong link to the parent class? (!!)
       - make possible to change basic linker options (opImageBase, and so on)
       - look like opGCHeapSize and opSizeOfHeapCommit are connected with each other
       - should codeBase is always 0x1000?; maybe should be customized (see !!
         remark in linker)
       - writeNtHeader: stack size and similar parameters is constant; maybe should
         be possible to customize (see !! remark in linker)
       - support resources in exe file

       - try to optimize the parser table (less number of symbols)
       - inline classes can be created at the first reference to it and exists
         until the next GC call.
       - localization
       - support the following types of unicode source files:little endian, UTF-8?
       - new option target CPU: 386 / 686
       - add new coder: 686Coder whic override x86Coder
       - optimize the most critical code parts like send / redirect / cast routines
         using pentium commands
       - get rid of wait command for float-base operations?

       - try to use pairing instructions
       - MMX, SSE, SSE2 commands; could we start to use these commands?
       - PREFETCH command could be useful
       - compiler option which specifies the target CPU
    - relative fixup works incorrectly if the reference has an offset
    - optimize hash table filling for Linker tables

    - optimize the code using profiler
    - check for memory leaking (either profiler or simple check on the start
      and on the finish)
    - optimize hash table filling for ParserTable
    - check for all invalid / valid combination (russia characters)
    - check the debugger behavior in the case of system exception
      (does event EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_EVENT occur in this case);

--------------------
[o] IDE development:
--------------------
    - should search history be saved, where (in the project / ide config / and so on)
    - implements new features: quick short cut
    - review known bugs
    - improve debugger
    - create simple version of ELENA Code Wizard which add new menu item
    - continue localization
    - give more useful error message if forward symbol is not declared
    - raise an exception if debug module not found by debug controller
    - debugger should use engine's LibraryManager
    - review and refactor elc output redirect routine
    - move fast short cut to autoform plugin
    - show the list of possible messages
    - auto add shortcuts
    - clear keyboard buffer before the program run
    - auto trim for tailing whitespaces (space and tab) - the idea is not to save
      whitespace until the user not to insert any character
    - open all recent files
    - option to ignore unresolved references warning within the project namespace
    - display current file encoding in the status bar
    - ctrl+F8 go to the next statement
    - investigate stepping over / into annex inline symbols (e.g. $createHandle)
    - prevent from slowing down on the program exit (make possible to inidicate
      to the sistem that this step is the last in the program)
    - optimize debugger step collection access (use some kind of hash table,
      divide the code range into several bands and before direct search use
      it to narrow collection)
    - we do not need stop over inline symbols (except at the symbol beginning)
    - try to deal with the slowing debugger when it goes through the window
      system code in trap mode (e.g. in case of failed method in GUI application
      which terminates the application - is it correct?)
      (try to use breakpoint for any external code call to skip the step mode
      inside external written code - in fact no sense to do it)
    - gui applications are not released from the memory after debugging
    - test Undo / Redo operations for the small capacity (~40 or 50);
    - test operations with tab both virtual and real;
    - refactor dialogs module
    - too many duplicate code in editframe (toLowercase, toUpperCase, trim and
      so on), could we get rid of it?
    - maybe use CP_OEMCP then CP_ACP?
    - optimize (Styler)
    - check if window child created handles are destroyed (destroy method)
    - try to use DFA class for IDE sourcedoc class
    - possible problem when coping ascii text through clipboad - test with russian text
    - undo in overwrite mode works a bit strange
    - why if we have an error we do not see the warnings in messages window?
    - Plugins - and display message when selected
    - highlight the current line
    - new ide settings dialog: autocomp
    - debug watch should be able to display the longest possible identifer
      with the longest possible type e.g. IDENTIFIER_LEN * 2
    - show escape symbols
    - should not be possible close / open / compile project during debug -
      either break the debug or stop the operation
    - debugwatch should indicate if the object plays a role (shifted mode)
    - convert encoding routines
    - make possible not to load some source files (to simplify the debugging)
    - before start debugging make sure debug module is up to date
    - indent / outdent should align the selected code rather then simply
      move it (like in VS IDE)
    - find out optimal page size / history buffer capacity
    - tune up horizontal and vertical scrollers (like it's done in NP++)
    - set read only (?)
    - hide status bar (?)
    - display correct messages when the project is not compiled (missing
      exe / source files)
    - save the last active document / cursor position (?)
    - shows the number of warnings
    - source code assisten plug-in written with ELENA
    - configurable styles: colors / fonts
    - Outlining
    - Class Wizard
    - Auto complete?
    - Code patterns?
    - Message dictionary
    - error recovering (several errors)
    - make possible to change all tabs to spaces
    - code patterns like in VS (type short cut and press tab-tab)
    - Print
    - add Add Watch menu option
    - full screen mode
    - "find in files" function
    - Two editor panels like in NPP
    - clone current view
    - macros
    - autoformat
    - zoom in / zoom out
    - try to bring as much functionality as in notepad++
    - an icon on tab page?
    - make possible to treat the object as an array of bytes
    - make sure in the case of crash saveAllAsDraft and saveSettings are called
    - should we add the path to the recent history right after the project
      was open (or save the project even the program is crashed)
    - try to minimize the number of repaint (after pressing F8 repaint is invoked
      two times instead of one)
    - introduce project templates (with basic forwards)
    - make possible not to close the console window after the program finishing
    - add the editor option controlling this feature
    - tips?
    - new short-cut to got to message / output window
    - remove the code to import old style project file (project\projecttype)
    - why we create the string every time in EditFrame::paint function?
