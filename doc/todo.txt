    * verifyMultimethods implements
    * explicit multimethod
    * call interface method
    * optimization - call method directly
    * compiler - calling a constructor method directly

    * compiler - if the method has no call operarion, no need to set arg length
    * dispatching a message in compile-time when it is possible
    * bcwriter : openFrame - should flush only used arguments (e.g. for test[1] - only one xflush)

    * optimization sealed dispatching
    * optimization single dispatching
    * private method dispatching

    * fix : for ppc64 / arm64 - there should be alternative version to deal with args more than 9 / 12 / 16 bits

    * optimization - openin - increase number of optimization - open 4,0; open 1,n; open 2,n; open 3,n; open 4,n
    * modules - add reference cache
    * elenavm support : windows / linus, x86, ppc64le, arm64

    + optimiation : assinging int constant, 
    + no duplicate variable by boxing
    + optimization - true.Inverted should return constant directly, without calling symbol
    + loading call argument in reverse order, so no need to load self once again
    + optimization : embeddable return - extra variable
    + optimization : dispatching to the primitive field (e.g. ref<byte>)
    + optimization : branching - extra temporal variable
    + (re)implement long invert op
    + warn if both a parameter and a local variable have the same name
    + dispatcin : do not use frame if not nessesary
    + optimization : do not use frame if not nessesary
    + * operator with object wrapper - sould be pass direct value, so no need for dispatcin in ref interface
      e.g: theIndex.append(cast int(theDiff)); - should be written theIndex.append(*theDiff); and the stack-allocated
     object should be passed as is
    + ide 64 : call stack
    + QuckSorting : optimize the code - built-in branching should be used 
    + extension with primitive arrays - no need to box
    + new attribute - constant operation - do indicate that the class itself is not changed

    * do not save the external operation if the result is not assigned or passed as an argument
    * optimization - duplicate assigning : external call, message call
    * symbol - do not use a frame if not requiered (e.g. it is a leaf call)
    * optimization : method returning constant
    * by default always allocate 4 variables, assigning argument list - could we do it only once for a whole statement?
    * idle typecast method should simply return itself
    * optimize generated code : assigning, boxing, returning

    + mixings ruby style
    * corex - edi should contain the thread TLS pointer??
    + introduce inline attribute testOp so all marked function will be executed by Tester class (e.g extensions'tests)
    + should we get rid of loadi / savei??

    + post : mixin instead of mutli-inheritance (lec24) - simple way to include several roles into the class
    + housekeeping - review pipeline
    * migrate all samples to win64
    + using inline arguments in the code : some ideas
    + compilation speed - Amicable pairs variants

    * xforms - set property returns the object itself, redesign the current mode; probably we could return the property value

    * multi-theading
    * thread - make sure stack is correctly aligned to 16

    + housekeeping - review pipeline
    + closure tape : review how it could be optimized (e.g interpreter.solution1)
    + bf interpreter optimization

    + housekeeping - review pipeline
    + #69 : GC info 
    + docs : introduce __target built-in variable
    + housekeeping - review pipeline

    * use message, extension, symbol correctly for x32 and x64
    * message and messagename should not be the same

    * do we need win64_pointers.l / win32_pointers.l and win64_strings.l / win32_strings.l or there is no difference?

                 * optimize dirty_ptr := dirty_ptr + int
                 * building expression tree - raise an exceptoion with missing class name
                 * the following code should not be allowed - real n := n;

                 * optimize intOp.Absolute method
                 * variadic closure : correctly free argument list - using the code to free until the zero is encounter
                 * bool_expr ? 1 : 0 - the expression result should be strong-typed
                 * optimize compiler : more efficient hash table, caching the results
                 * the following code should generate an error - lazy::(n < 5) - missing ^
                 * direct and, or, xor, shift, mul, div, equal, less
                 * pusha new bcopya popa => bcopya new bswap nop??
                 * Handle, Char : there should be special enbeddable cast T<int> = field - to allow using the integer field

                 * debugger : display message name
                 * optimize hash table implementation (both weak and strong typed)
                 * support seriaization properties - indicating which properties should be serilized
                 * warn if the attribute value is not set

                 * supporting : const fields - constant values
                 * symbols : a += b
                 * fields : a += b
                 * arrays : a[i] += b

                 * (re)implement hashTable, using links, load control and so on

                 * implement Heap, Balanced Search Tree and Hash tables, review Map<T,Key> template, if it could be
                   optimized
                 * implement correctly - a[i][j] += 1 (see World Cup group stage)
                 * modify quicksort to use insert selection for smaller amount (test on anagram)

                 * review RealNumber.#new<system'IntNumber>[1], is a new object created twice

                 * review if ref<int>.Value works correctly (it is embedded)
                 * check CharValue.WideLength
                 * review String / WideString, get rid of internal methods - use them directly

                 * review elenasm - simplify the coordination info, probably it should be encoded into the log itself,
                   so no need to fill the list (what about the string in calc sample)

                 * (re)implement tape debugger

                 * simplify operations with ref variable - if (0 == (cast int(theTop))) { ... }
                 * attribute cannot be used as a class constant - s the code - 
                       = { bool equal(o) = self(object); }; - is not allowed
                 * allow to work with ref<int> directly

                 * uncomment __closuretape."#dispatch[1]  - check the subject correctly

                 * support public & private templates
                 * property templates cannot be used directly and class templates cannot be used as a property one

                 * unboxing of boxing (in case if analizer does not resolve the issue)
                 * cache resolved built-in tampletes
                 * optimizate operations with byref dynamic variable (no need for boxing / unboxing) - should be locally
                   boxed
                 * support mta_gui, vm_mta_console
                 * the following code does not work - theOwner.resize(int width, int height)  (see forms'SDIWindowListener.onsize)
                 * interface - can the wrapper class be saved to use it several times?
                 * set operation with constant array should not be allowed
                 * support static prefix to allow operations with static field only
                 * sealed static fields, cannot be changed in the child classes?!
 
                 * mta system : check the situation when too many threads (> MAX_THREAD)
                 * nested code : read only outer field
                 * elt - exception handler
                 * script engine : do not allow left recursing (e.g. A -> AB )
                 * replace S -> AB / S -> AC with S -> A{B | C}, using forwards to resolve prediction log
                 * advanced script : templates,closures,exception handling
                 * an array of int - no need to fill, one by one?
                 * optimize default multi-method, do we need frame?
                 * warn if the extension method overrides the target method - it will not be called?
