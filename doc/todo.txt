                   work
                 * attribute cannot be used as a class constant - s the code - 
                       = { bool equal(o) = self(object); }; - is not allowed

                 * simplify DerivationWriter :: newNode - use a common mask for all expression nonterminals
                 * optimizate operations with byref dynamic variable (no need for boxing / unboxing) - should be locally
                   boxed
