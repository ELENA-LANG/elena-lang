ELENA Script Engine : Creating your own script language

In this article we will see how to implement your own script language using ELENA script engine.

We will take several implementations of Bulls and Cows from Rosetta code site (Javascript, BBC Basic and Julia) and will try
to implement a grammar to run them. We will create a two versions: dynamic interpreter and a statically compiled program.

Of course we are not going to make it 100% compatible with our target languages, our goal is to demonstrate how the script engine
could be used to customize ELENA language.
